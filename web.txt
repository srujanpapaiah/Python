Quantifying Peace and its Benefits
The Institute for Economics & Peace (IEP) is an independent, non-partisan, non-profit think tank dedicated to shifting the world's focus to peace as a positive, achievable, and tangible measure of human well-being and progress.
IEP achieves its goals by developing new conceptual frameworks to define peacefulness; providing metrics for measuring peace; and uncovering the relationships between business, peace and prosperity as well as promoting a better understanding of the cultural, economic and political factors that create peace.
IEP is headquartered in Sydney, with offices in New York, The Hague, Mexico City, Brussels and Harare. It works with a wide range of partners internationally and collaborates with intergovernmental organisations on measuring and communicating the economic value of peace.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY




This is the 14th edition of the Global Peace Index (GPI), which ranks 163 independent states and territories according to their level of peacefulness. Produced by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), the GPI is the world's leading measure of global peacefulness. This report presents the most comprehensive data- driven analysis to-date on trends in peace, its economic value, and how to develop peaceful societies.

The GPI covers 99.7 per cent of the world's population, using 23 qualitative and quantitative indicators from highly respected sources, and measures the state of peace across three domains: the level of Societal Safety and Security; the extent of Ongoing Domestic and International Conflict; and the degree of Militarisation.

In addition to presenting the findings from the 2020 GPI, this year's report includes an analysis of the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on peace, including Positive Peace: the attitudes, institutions and structures that create and sustain peaceful societies. It examines how the impact of the pandemic, and in particular its economic consequences will increase the risk of severe deteriorations in Positive Peace over the next few years, and also examines which countries are best placed to recover from the shock.

The results this year show that the level of global peacefulness deteriorated, with the average country score falling by 0.34 per cent. This is the ninth deterioration in peacefulness in the last twelve years, with 81 countries improving, and 80 recording deteriorations over the past year. The 2020 GPI reveals a world in which the conflicts and crises that emerged in the past decade have begun to abate, only to be replaced with a new wave of tension and uncertainty as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Iceland remains the most peaceful country in the world, a position it has held since 2008. It is joined at the top of the index by New Zealand, Austria, Portugal, and Denmark.

Afghanistan is the least peaceful country in the world for the second year in a row, followed by Syria, Iraq, South Sudan and Yemen. All, except Yemen, have been ranked amongst the five least peaceful since at least 2015.

Only two of the nine regions in the world became more peaceful over the past year. The greatest improvement occurred in the Russia and Eurasia region, followed by




North America. North America was the only region to record improvements across all three domains, while Russia and Eurasia recorded improvements in Ongoing Conflict and Safety and Security, but a deterioration on the Militarisation domain.

South America and Central America and the Caribbean recorded the largest and second largest deterioration on the 2020 GPI. While South America's average deterioration in peacefulness was driven by deteriorations on Militarisation and Safety and Security, the fall in peacefulness in Central America and the Caribbean was driven by changes in Ongoing Conflict.

Peacefulness has declined 2.5 percent since 2008 with 81 GPI countries recording a deterioration, and 79 improving. Fifteen of the 23 GPI indicators are less peaceful on average in 2020 when compared to 2008.

Two of the three GPI domains deteriorated over the past decade, with Ongoing Conflict deteriorating by 6.8 per cent and Safety and Security deteriorating by 3.3 per cent. Terrorism and internal conflict have been the biggest contributors to the global deterioration in peacefulness. Ninety-seven countries recorded increased terrorist activity, while only 43 had lower levels of terrorism. However, after peaking in 2014 during the height of the Syrian civil war, total deaths from terrorism have fallen every year for the last five years.

By contrast, the Militarisation domain has recorded a
4.4 per cent improvement since 2008. The number of armed services personnel per 100,000 people has fallen in 113 countries, and military expenditure as a percentage of GDP fell in 100.

This year's report also looks at the trends in civil unrest over the past decade. It finds that there has been a sharp increase in civil unrest events since 2011, with over 96 countries experiencing at least one violent demonstration in 2019. From 2011 to 2019, the number of riots rose by 282 per cent and general strikes rose by 821 per cent.

Europe had the largest number of protests, riots and strikes over the period, totalling nearly 1,600 events from 2011 to 2018. Sixty-five per cent of the civil unrest events in Europe were nonviolent. Civil unrest in
sub-Saharan Africa rose by more than 800 per cent over the period, from 32 riots and protests in 2011 to 292 in 2018.






GLOBAL PEACE INDEX 2020  | 2




The only GPI region not to experience an increase in civil unrest from 2011 to 2018 was the Middle East and North Africa, with total civil unrest events falling 60 per cent over that period. However, 2011 was the height of the Arab Spring in the region, with protests and demonstrations turning into open conflict and civil war in some countries, most notably in Syria.

The economic impact of violence on the global economy in 2019 was $14.5 trillion in purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. This figure is equivalent to 10.6 per cent of the world's economic activity (gross world product) or $1,909 per person. The economic impact of violence improved by 0.2 per cent from 2018 to 2019. The biggest improvement was in armed conflict, which decreased by 29 per cent to $521 billion, owing to a fall in the intensity of conflict in the Middle East and North Africa. There was also a substantial reduction in the economic impact of terrorism, which fell by 48 per cent from 2018 to 2019.

Violence continues to have a significant impact on economic performance around the globe. In the ten countries most affected by violence, the average economic impact of violence was equivalent to 41 per cent of GDP on average, compared to under four per cent in the countries least affected by violence. Syria, South Sudan, Afghanistan and Venezuela incurred the largest proportional economic cost of violence in 2019, equivalent to 60, 57, 51 and 48 per cent of GDP, respectively.

The report's Positive Peace research focuses on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Positive Peace. Positive Peace measures a country's ability to maintain peace. Falls in Positive Peace usually precede falls in peace. The impact of the pandemic, in particular its economic consequences, will likely have a severe impact on the way societies function. This impact could lead to deteriorations in Positive Peace and increase the risk of outbreaks of violence and conflict. Europe is likely to see an increase in civil unrest as the looming recession bites, while many countries in Africa will face famine conditions, creating further stress on many fragile countries.

Countries with strong Positive Peace have higher resilience to absorb, adapt and recover from shocks, such as COVID-19 and the ensuing recession. In particular, nations that perform well on the Well- Functioning Government and  Sound  Business Environment Pillars of the Positive Peace Index are more likely to recover relatively quickly from the crisis.

There is also some evidence to suggest that countries with higher levels of Positive Peace have been quicker to adapt and respond to the pandemic. Looking just at nations within the OECD, countries that perform better on the Well-Functioning Government and High Levels of

Human Capital Pillars have been able to test a higher proportion of their population for the COVID-19 virus.

The 2020 GPI report also has a special focus on IEP's newest research report - the Ecological Threat Register (ETR), which combines a confluence of ecological risks with Positive Peace and economic coping capacity to better understand what future potential risks and fragilities nations will face in the next three decades. It also extrapolates population projections to 2050 to better understand the areas which will be most impacted.

The ETR aims to show both exposure to risk and the ability of nations to deal with these ecological risks. The increase in the number of ecological threats can already be seen. The total number of natural disasters has tripled in the last four decades, while their economic impact has also increased, rising from US$50 billion in the 1980s to US$200 billion per year in the last decade. More than two billion people already live in countries experiencing high water stress. By 2050, climate change is expected to create up to 86 million additional migrants in sub-Saharan Africa, 40 million in South Asia and 17 million in Latin America.

KEY FINDINGS


SECTION 1: RESULTS
j The average level of global peacefulness deteriorated 0.34 per cent on the 2020 GPI. This is the ninth time in the last 12 years that global peacefulness has deteriorated.
j In the past year 80 countries recorded deteriorations in peacefulness, while 81 recorded improvements.
j The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region remained the world's least peaceful region. It is home to four of the ten least peaceful countries in the world, with no country from the region ranked higher than 27th on the GPI.
j Europe remains the most peaceful region in the world, although it recorded a slight deterioration in peacefulness. The region is home to 13 of the 20 most peaceful countries, and only two


European countries are not ranked in the top half of the index.
j Peacefulness improved on average on the Militarisation domain, but deteriorated on both the Ongoing Conflict and Safety and Security domains.
j Of the 23 GPI indicators, eight recorded an improvement, 12 had a deterioration, with the remaining three indicators not registering any change over the past year.
j After years of improvements in average military spending, there was an increase in military expenditure as a percentage of GDP for the first time in five years. Seventy-nine countries had deteriorations on this indicator.



SECTION 2: TRENDS IN PEACEFULNESS
j The average level of global peacefulness has deteriorated by 2.5 per cent since 2008. Over that period, 81 countries deteriorated in peacefulness, while 79 improved.
j The average level of country peacefulness has deteriorated for nine of the past 12 years.
j The gap between the least and most peaceful countries continues to grow. Since 2008, the 25 least peaceful countries declined on average by 12.9 per cent, while the 25 most peaceful countries improved by 2.1 per cent.
j The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) remains the world's least peaceful region for the sixth consecutive year. It is less peaceful than the global average for 19 of the 23 GPI indicators.


j There has been a sharp rise in the level of civil unrest over the last decade, with over 96 countries experiencing at least one violent demonstration in 2019.
j From 2011 to 2019, the number of riots, general strikes and
anti-government demonstrations around the world increased by 244 per cent.
j Europe had the largest number of protests, riots and strikes over the period, totalling nearly 1,600 events from 2011 to 2018.
Sixty-five per cent of the civil unrest events in Europe were nonviolent.
j Civil unrest in sub-Saharan Africa rose by more than 800 per cent over the period, from 32 riots and protests in 2011 to 292 in 2018.



SECTION 3: ECONOMIC IMPACT OF VIOLENCE
j The global economic impact of violence was $14.5 trillion PPP in 2019, equivalent to 10.6 per cent of global GDP or $1,909 per person.
j The global economic impact of violence improved for the second year in a row, decreasing by 0.2 per cent or $29 billion from 2018 to 2019. However, it is $1.25 trillion higher than what is was in 2012.
j The improvement was largely due to the decrease in the impact of Armed Conflict particularly in the Middle East and North Africa region.
j The biggest improvement in the economic impact was for Armed Conflict, which decreased by 11 per cent or $66 billion in 2019 to
$521 billion. This was because of improvements in deaths from

SECTION 4: POSITIVE PEACE
j The COVID-19 pandemic will cause substantial changes in how society operates and business is conducted in most countries.
j Positive Peace offers a framework for interpreting and describing the COVID-19 crisis.
j Nations that are more likely to recover relatively quickly from the crisis are those which combine low levels of public debt with strong performance in the Well-Functioning Government Pillar.


terrorism and GDP losses from conflict, which fell by 48 per cent and 21 per cent respectively.
j The major costs associated with Armed Conflict is refugees and displaced persons. The costs associated with supporting them amounts to 64 per cent of the total or $333 billion.
j Syria, South Sudan and Afghanistan incurred the largest economic cost of violence in 2019 as a percentage of their GDP, equivalent to 60, 57 and 51 per cent of GDP, respectively.
j In the ten countries most economically affected by violence, the average economic cost was equivalent to 41 per cent of GDP. In the ten most peaceful countries the average economic cost was
3.9 per cent of GDP.


j The crisis and the social isolation response are expected to send most countries into recession in 2020. The travel and tourism industries are likely to incur severe contractions.
j Other industries affected are hospitality, retail trade, mineral resources, education, recreation, energy and shipping.
j Countries with strong Positive Peace have higher resilience to absorb, adapt and recover from shocks, such as COVID-19 and the ensuing recession.



SECTION 5: ECOLOGICAL THREAT REGISTER
j The number of natural disasters has tripled in the last four decades.
j By 2050, climate change is estimated to create up to 86 million additional migrants in sub-Saharan Africa, 40 million in South Asia and 17 million in Latin America.
j Climate change induced ecological threats are strongly correlated with Positive Peace, suggesting that high peace countries have greater capacity to adapt to climate change and deal with its adverse impacts.


j 873 million people experienced severe food insecurity and hunger in 2017.
j The risk of food insecurity could increase fourfold in the world's most food insecure nations compared to those at low risk as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
j More than two billion people live in countries experiencing high water stress, and about four billion people experience severe water scarcity for at least one month of the year. Water use has increased by one per cent per year for the last four decades.

j The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region remained the world's least peaceful region. It is home to four of the ten least peaceful countries in the world, with no country from the region ranked higher than 27th on the GPI.
j Europe remains the most peaceful region in the world, although it recorded a slight deterioration in peacefulness. The region is home to 13 of the 20 most peaceful countries, and only two European countries are not ranked in the top half of the index.

j Peacefulness improved on average in the Militarisation domain, but deteriorated in both the Ongoing Conflict and Safety and Security domains.
j Of the 23 GPI indicators, eight recorded an improvement, 12 had a deterioration, with the remaining three indicators not registering any change over the past year.
j After years of improvements in average military spending, there was an increase in military expenditure as a percentage of GDP for the first time in five years. 79 countries had deteriorations on this indicator.
j Despite the overall deterioration in the safety and security domain, there were a number of indicators which improved on average, including the homicide rate and terrorism impact indicators. Total deaths from terrorism are now at their lowest point in the last decade.

Highlights


Global peacefulness has deteriorated over the past year. This is the fourth time in the last five years that the world has seen a fall in peacefulness. The average country score deteriorated by 0.34 per cent, with 81 countries improving, and 80 recording deteriorations in peacefulness.


The Global Peace Index (GPI) measures more than just the presence or absence of war. It captures the absence of violence or the fear of violence across three domains: Safety and Security, Ongoing Conflict, and Militarisation. Both the Ongoing Conflict and Safety and Security domains recorded deteriorations, with only the Militarisation domain recording an improvement. Of the 23 GPI indicators, eight recorded an improvement, 12 had a deterioration, while the remaining three indicators did not change in the past year.
The world is now considerably less peaceful than it was at the inception of the index. Since 2008 the average level of country peacefulness has deteriorated 3.76 per cent. There have been year on year deteriorations in
peacefulness for nine of the last 12 years. The fall in peacefulness over the past decade was

Europe recorded a slight deterioration in peacefulness on the 2020 GPI, owing to falls in the Ongoing Conflict and Safety and Security domains. It is now considerably less peaceful than it was in 2008. Sixteen European countries recorded an improvement in peacefulness from the 2019 to 2020 GPI, with 19 recording deteriorations. Despite its high levels of peacefulness, Europe has higher levels of Militarisation than many regions around the world, particularly in regards to weapons exports and nuclear and heavy weapons.
The largest regional improvement in peacefulness occurred in Russia and Eurasia, with eight of the 12 countries in the region recording improvements. This is the fourth straight
year of improvement for the region. This was driven by improvements in the Safety and Security domain, with improvements on

caused by a wide range of factors, including increased terrorist activity, the intensification of conflicts in the Middle East, rising regional tensions in Eastern Europe and Northeast Asia, and increasing numbers of refugees and heightened political tensions in Europe and the US.

The Global Peace Index measures more than just the presence or absence of war.



the homicide rate, incarceration rate, terrorism impact and political instability indicators. The biggest regional deterioration occurred in South America, also owing to changes in the Safety and Security domain. There were notable deteriorations in the incarceration rate and

However, despite the overall deterioration in peacefulness, some indicators have recorded significant improvements over the past 13 years. The largest improvements have occurred in the Militarisation domain, with 113 countries reducing their armed forces rate, 100 reducing military expenditure as a percentage of GDP, and 67 lowering their levels of nuclear and heavy weapons. The homicide rate has also fallen steadily in many countries, with 117 countries having a lower homicide rate now than in 2008.
The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region remained the world's least peaceful. It is home to three of the five least peaceful countries in the world, with no country from the region ranked higher than 27th on the GPI. However, despite ongoing armed conflict and instability in the region, it did record improvements on many indicators. The number of deaths from internal conflict continued to fall, and the intensity of internal conflict also improved in the region. Both weapons imports and weapons exports improved over the past year.
Europe remains the most peaceful region and is home to six of the ten most peaceful countries in the world. However,

the likelihood of violent demonstrations.
Of the three GPI domains, only Militarisation recorded an improvement, with UN peacekeeping funding and both weapons imports and weapons exports having significant improvements. Although the armed services personnel rate deteriorated slightly on average, the majority of countries recorded improvements, with 99 countries reducing the size of their armed forces rate as a percentage of their population.
In contrast, military expenditure deteriorated for the first time since 2016, with 79 countries recording increases in total military expenditure as a percentage of GDP. However, over the longer term military expenditure has been steadily declining, with the average level of military expenditure falling from 2.32 to 2.2 per cent of GDP since 2008.
Both the weapons imports and weapons exports indicators improved on the 2020 GPI and are now at their lowest level since 2009. The weapons exports indicator continues to reflect the unequal geographic distribution of the global arms industry, with 63 per cent of countries having no weapons exports over the past five years. Of the 11 countries with the highest levels of per capita weapons exports, eight are in




Europe with the remaining three countries being the US, Russia, and Israel.
The Safety and Security domain deteriorated on average, with 89 countries deteriorating and 70 improving. The trend towards more authoritarian government was reflected across several indicators, with the political terror scale, police rate, and incarceration rate all deteriorating. The number of violent demonstrations continued to rise around the world, reflected in outbreaks of social unrest in Chile and Hong Kong. While the level of social unrest has fallen in the first half of 2020, partly in result of government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, the possibility of future violence remains high.
Not every aspect of Safety and Security deteriorated. The terrorism impact indicator continued to improve, with total deaths from terrorism falling to 15,952, down from a peak of 33,555 five years earlier. In total, 92 countries had an improvement on the terrorism impact indicator. Similarly, the homicide rate indicator continued its decade long improvement, with 57 countries recording an improvement on this indicator, compared to 42 that deteriorated. In El Salvador, the country with the highest number of homicides per 100,000 people, the homicide rate fell by 25 per cent.
The 2020 GPI reveals a world in which the tensions, conflicts, and crises that emerged in the past decade remain

unresolved, but some progress has been made towards achieving peace. While long-running conflicts have begun to decline or at least plateau, the underlying causes of many of these conflicts have not been addressed, and the potential for violence to flare up remains very real. There have also been new tensions arising, and growing dissatisfaction with governments around the world which has led to an increasing authoritarian response in some countries.
Additionally, although the institutions and structures of Positive Peace have improved over the last decade, attitudes of Positive Peace have deteriorated over the last ten years. Positive Peace is a strong leading indicator of future peacefulness, with large deteriorations in Positive Peace being statistically linked to later falls in peace. High levels of Positive Peace also allow societies to respond to and recover from exogenous shocks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which is currently engulfing the world. If the fall in Positive Peace continues, and the attitudes, institutions and structures that build and sustain peaceful societies are not supported and strengthened, it seems likely that the overall deterioration in peacefulness will continue in the years to come.

Results


The 2020 GPI finds that the world became less peaceful for the ninth time in the last 12 years, with the average level of country peacefulness deteriorating by 0.34 per cent over the past year. Figure 1.1 shows the change in the average levels of peacefulness for the overall score and for each of the domains, as well as the percentage of countries that improved or deteriorated. In total, peacefulness improved in 81 countries and deteriorated in 80.


The deterioration in peacefulness was mainly due to a deterioration in the Safety and Security domain. Political instability deteriorated as did other associated indicators, such as violent demonstrations. Furthermore, the rise of authoritarianism in response to this trend has caused a deterioration on the political terror scale, and a rise in the police rate and incarceration rate.

There was a deterioration in the Ongoing Conflict domain, with rises in both the total number of conflicts fought globally, and the overall intensity of internal conflict. However, despite the increase in the total number of conflicts the number of deaths from conflict, both internal and external, continued to fall, owing to the defeat of ISIL in Syria and Iraq, and the winding down of the civil war in Syria.

The only domain improvement in the 2020 GPI was in Militarisation. This was driven by an improvement in UN peacekeeping funding, and a fall in the level of both weapons imports and weapons exports. Both weapons indicators are now at their most peaceful level since 2009.

Twelve of the 23 GPI indicators deteriorated on average, with eight improving and four remaining unchanged. Figure 1.2 shows the average percentage change for each indicator from the 2019 to the 2020 GPI. The overall largest average deterioration was in the refugees and IDPs indicator, while the weapons imports indicator had the largest improvement.

Regional Overview


Only two of the nine regions in the world improved in peacefulness in 2020: North America and Russia and Eurasia. South America experienced the largest average deterioration and was the only region to record deteriorations across all three domains GPI domains: Safety and Security, Militarisation and Ongoing Conflict.


Europe maintained its position as the most peaceful region in the world, which it has held since the inception of the GPI. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) recorded a slight deterioration in peacefulness and remained the least peaceful region, a position it has held since 2015.

North America recorded an improvement of 1.28 per cent, with Russia and Eurasia having a slightly smaller improvement of 1.23 per cent. North America was the only region to record improvements across all three domains, while Russia and Eurasia recorded improvements in Ongoing Conflict and Safety and Security but a deterioration on Militarisation.

South America had the biggest fall in peacefulness, with deteriorations across all three domains.

Sub-Saharan Africa recorded a slight deterioration of 0.5 per cent but as a large region, changes in peacefulness varied substantially between countries.

The deterioration in Asia-Pacific's overall score was driven by indicators in the Militarisation and the Ongoing Conflict domains. There were particularly notable deteriorations on deaths from internal conflicts, increasing military expenditure and a weaker commitment to UN peacekeeping funding.

South America and Central America and the Caribbean both recorded deteriorations on the 2020 GPI. While South America's average deterioration in peacefulness was driven by deteriorations on Militarisation and Safety and Security, the fall in peacefulness in Central America and the Caribbean was driven by changes in Ongoing Conflict.


ASIA-PACIFIC
Peace deteriorated slightly in the Asia-Pacific region in the 2020 GPI, with a 0.2 per cent average decrease in peacefulness. The deterioration was driven by increasing deaths from internal  conflict, increasing military expenditure and a weaker commitment to UN peacekeeping funding. However, there were improvements in the homicide rate and violent crime indicators.

Five countries in Asia-Pacific continue to rank in the top 25 of the GPI. New Zealand ranks first in the region and second overall in the 2020 GPI, despite a deterioration in its score of 2.3 per cent. This was driven by a significant deterioration in terrorism impact because of the white-nationalist terror attack on two mosques in Christchurch on March 15 2019. Fifty-one people were killed in the attacks.1

Singapore is the second most peaceful country in the region, and the seventh most peaceful country overall. It had an overall improvement in peacefulness, owing to falls in the homicide rate, incarceration rate, and armed forces rate.

Australia is ranked fourth in the region and 13th in the global ranking. Its score has improved by 0.7 per cent as a consequence of an improvement in its political terror scale score from 1.5 to one. Australia has, however, had a continuous rise in its weapons imports since 2017, and now has one of the highest rates of weapons imports per capita in the world.

North Korea ranked last in the region and was the only Asia-Pacific country to rank in the bottom 25 of the GPI. The deterioration in North Korea's 2020 score is driven by a substantial reduction in UN peacekeeping funding. The United Nations Security Council's sanctions have placed extreme pressure on the North Korean economy, and despite President Trump's historic visit to the country in June 2019, North Korea continues to test strategic missiles in violation of UN resolutions.

Indonesia and Timor-Leste have recorded the biggest deteriorations in the region. Indonesia deteriorated due to a spike in deaths from internal conflicts and internal conflicts fought, reflecting the fatal consequences of the religious conflict in Malaccas and indigenous- immigrant conflicts across the country, particularly in West Kalimantan. Indonesia has also experienced a substantial deterioration in political instability over the last year. Jakarta and other major cities saw several student-led protests in September and October 2019. The demonstrations aimed at persuading the president, Joko Widodo, to delay illiberal reforms to the country's criminal code and were ultimately successful.

The deterioration of peacefulness in Timor-Leste from 2019 to 2020 was driven by deteriorations in Safety and Security. The largest


deterioration occurred on the police rate indicator. Extreme poverty and high unemployment rates have led to high crime rates in Timor-Leste, increasing the demand for police. The country's political terror scale score has also deteriorated, increasing from 1.5 to two. Timor-Leste has, however, recorded improvements in Militarisation in the 2020 GPI due to greater commitment to UN peacekeeping funding.

China recorded a 0.9 per cent deterioration in overall peacefulness, owing largely to political unrest and violent demonstrations across the self-governing region of Hong Kong. The protests began after the government introduced a Fugitive Offenders amendment bill. Even though the bill was withdrawn in September 2019, demonstrations continued on afterwards. These clashes between protesters and security forces over the introduction of the bill led to a deterioration in the country's violent demonstrations score. The incarceration rate also grew, with the latest estimates suggesting that as many as 1.5 million Uighyurs and other ethnic minorities have been imprisoned in 're-education' camps in the Xinjiang autonomous region.


CENTRAL AMERICA & THE CARIBBEAN
Peacefulness in Central America and The Caribbean deteriorated in the 2020 GPI, with an increasing number of deaths from external conflict and deteriorating scores on the political terror scale. The region deteriorated by 1.2 per cent on average, with seven out of the 13 countries in the region experiencing deterioration in peacefulness.

The past year in the region has been characterized by civil unrest, high levels of perceived corruption and economic hardship. The closing of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) in 2019 and high levels of perceived corruption in Honduras has led to violent protests and fuelled internal and international migration. In addition, violent conflict in Haiti, Nicaragua and Mexico have increased the number of refugees fleeing violence in the region. This has also exacerbated tensions between these countries and the US.

Despite a year of political and social unrest, Costa Rica remains the most peaceful country in the region. Its homicide rate increased from 11.9 homicides per 100,000 people to 12.3 in the last year. The

TABLE 1.5
Central America & The Carribean

country has also experienced a surge in migration as a spill-over from the conflict in Nicaragua, with approximately 55,000 of the 70,000 Nicaraguan refugees in 2019 migrating to Costa Rica.

Panama, the second most peaceful country in the region, also experienced political and social unrest in the last year with the government attempting to roll back rights for marginalised groups in society. This is reflected in a deterioration in Panama's political instability score and its intensity of conflict score. In its first months in office, the government of Laurentino Cortizo, launched a process to reform the constitution. As the reforms moved through the legislature, deputies tacked on a series of additional and highly controversial amendments. Positional differences over constitutional reforms will present a latent risk to stability as the government moves forward with the reform process.

Mexico is once again the least peaceful country in the region. It had one of its deadliest years on record, resulting in a 2.3 per cent deterioration in peacefulness. The homicide rate increased by 28.7 per cent, from 19.3 homicides per 100,000 people to 28.8. More recently, there has been an increase in cartel activity near the US border, as restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic have led to fighting between the cartels.2 The economic impact of violence in Mexico was 4.57 trillion pesos (US$238 billion) in 2019, equivalent to 21.3 per cent of the country's GDP.3

Nicaragua recorded the region's biggest deterioration in peacefulness over the last year of 9.2 per cent and ranked second last in the region. Increases in deaths from internal conflict, the likelihood of violent crime and a deterioration on the political terror scale have contributed significantly to this deterioration in peacefulness. An estimated 70,000 people fled Nicaragua in 2019 as a consequence of the government persecution.4 There has been an increase in criminal activity by paramilitary groups, and allegations that the government has tortured hundreds of political prisoners in response to widespread protests in 2018.


EUROPE
Europe remains the world's most peaceful region, despite recording a very slight deterioration in peacefulness on the 2020 GPI. Sixteen countries recorded improvements in peacefulness, with 19 having deteriorations. European countries account for 17 of the top 25 countries in the 2020 GPI, with Iceland being the highest ranking country in the region and also globally. Turkey is the only European country to be ranked in the bottom 25 least peaceful countries.

Despite being the world's most peaceful region, Europe has experienced political and economic unrest over the past year. Poland has experienced public mass-gatherings and protests  against the government's controversial law that allows government interference in the judicial system, while in Romania protesters took to the streets for months demonstrating against corruption.5 Mass-protests also erupted in Hungary after the government introduced a new labour market law, referred to by protesters as 'the slave law'. The yellow vest movement protests also continued in France.

More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has effectively put the Schengen agreement temporarily out of effect, and thrown several European countries into turmoil, particularly the UK, Italy and Spain. The full extent of the economic and political ramifications of the pandemic remains to be seen, but relations between countries in Europe have been strained by the response to the virus.

Iceland is once again the most peaceful country in the region and world, a position it has held since the inception of the index. The country did, however, record a slight deterioration in peacefulness on the 2020 GPI, driven by a deterioration in the homicide rate, and a small increase in military expenditure. Despite these changes,

Iceland's score on both these indicators remains much more peaceful than the global average.

Turkey remains the least peaceful country in Europe. It had a slight deterioration in peacefulness on the 2020 GPI, falling to 150th on the overall GPI rankings. The refugee crisis in Europe continued throughout 2019, leading to increasing tensions with Greece, as Turkey's authorities refused to stop refugees reaching the EU through its territories. In addition, the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan continues to suppress domestic political dissent, which led to a deterioration on the political instability and political terror scale indicators. Turkey also had an 8.3 per cent increase in its incarceration rate, from 318 prisoners per 100,000 people to 344.

Greece and Belgium had the biggest improvements in the region. While Greece's improvement in peacefulness is primarily driven by a better score on the political terror scale and a stronger commitment to UN peacekeeping funding, Belgium's progress stems from a lower homicide rate and fewer deaths from internal conflict.


MIDDLE EAST & NORTH AFRICA
The Middle East and North Africa remains the world's least peaceful region, despite improvements in peacefulness for 11 countries on the 2020 GPI. While both the Militarisation and Ongoing Conflict domains improved on average, there was a deterioration on the  Safety and Security domain, owing to increases in the likelihood of violent demonstrations, and a rise in political instability. Five of the ten least peaceful countries in the world are located in the MENA region, with only Qatar, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates being ranked in the top 50 most peaceful countries.

TABLE 1.7
Middle East & North Africa

Syria remains the least peaceful country in the region, and the second least peaceful country overall. However, the country recorded a slight improvement in peacefulness on the 2020 GPI, as the conflict and turmoil from the Syrian civil war continued to abate. Following the ceasefire deal of March 2020, around 35,000 displaced civilians have returned to their homes in Syria's north-western province of Idlib.6 However, millions of Syrians are still either displaced internally or are refugees.

Iraq is the second least peaceful country in the region and the third least peaceful overall. Violent demonstrations continue to be a concern for the Iraqi government, with the country having the maximum possible score on this indicator. Since protests erupted across the country in October 2019, Iraq has had more than 700 fatalities and thousands of severe injuries as a result of clashes between anti-government protesters and security forces.7

Iran had the largest fall in peacefulness in the region, with its score deteriorating by 5.4 per cent. It deteriorated across all three GPI domains, with the largest deterioration occurring in Safety and Security. Political instability and the prospect of more violent demonstrations continue to be the key drivers of deteriorating peacefulness. Iran has also been plagued by sporadic unrest largely owing to the impact of rising inflation and poor living standards on the population, combined with anger at elite level corruption and economic mismanagement. Given that inflation has soared and the currency continues to depreciate, public anger is increasingly likely to boil over into violent protests.

2019 was a year of political unrest and transition in Sudan. Over 200 people were killed by security forces during pro-democratic protests which led to the resignation of President Omar al-Bashir in April  2019. Sudan has, therefore, had a deterioration in violent demonstrations and political instability in the 2020 GPI. However, in August 2019 the Sovereignty Council of Sudan was established as a collective head of state for a 39-months transitional period, which will hopefully lead to increased political stability.

Bahrain had the biggest improvement in the region and the third largest improvement of any nation overall, with a 4.8 per cent improvement in its overall score. The kingdom has experienced fewer violent demonstrations and terrorism-related criminal investigations in the past year.


NORTH AMERICA
North America was one of only two regions to improve in peacefulness on the 2020 GPI, with an overall improvement in score of 1.28 per cent. Both Canada and the US had improvements in peacefulness, with the US having the larger of the two. This marks the first time since 2016 that the region had an average improvement in peacefulness. There is a considerable disparity in peacefulness between the two countries in the region, with Canada being ranked in the top ten most peaceful countries, and the US ranked 121st overall.

Peacefulness improved in the US for the first time since 2016, with the country's overall score improving by 1.54 per cent.
Improvements were recorded across all three GPI domains, with the largest coming in the Ongoing Conflict domain. The withdrawal of troops and winding back of involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan has led to a fall in the number of external conflict deaths over the past few years, although the involvement of the US in a number of smaller overseas conflicts resulted in its external conflicts fought indicator deteriorating. Every type of violent death

measured by the GPI fell in the US, with improvements in the homicide rate, terrorism impact, and deaths from both external and internal conflict.

Despite the improvement in internal peacefulness in the US, the level of Militarisation has increased over the past year. Both weapons exports and weapons imports per capita increased, and the US is now the fourth largest weapons exporter on a per capita basis, behind only France, Russia, and Israel. Military expenditure as a percentage of GDP and the armed services rate also rose.

Canada's overall level of peacefulness improved slightly, thanks to improvements in scores across all three GPI domains. The single largest improvement occurred on the terrorism impact indicator. Canada had a spike in terrorism between 2017 and 2018, with 16 people killed from 16 confirmed terrorist attacks. However, the number of attacks and deaths dropped in 2019, leading to the improvement in score on the 2020 GPI. Canada also had improvements both its incarceration rate and police rate.
However, there was a slight increase in the homicide rate, which rose to 1.8 per 100,000 people, and also slight increases in military expenditure and weapons exports.


RUSSIA & EURASIA
Russia and Eurasia was one of only two regions to record an improvement in peacefulness in the 2020 GPI. The region has experienced improvements on both the Ongoing Conflict and Safety and Security domains, with the biggest indicator improvements recorded on neighbouring countries relations, deaths from external conflict and the average homicide rate. Only three countries in the region had a deterioration in peacefulness in the 2020 GPI: Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Ukraine. This is the fourth successive year that peacefulness in the region has improved

Kazakhstan is the most peaceful country in the Russia and Eurasia region, and the 70th most peaceful country overall on the 2020 GPI. However, it also had the largest deterioration in the region, with the most significant change occurring on the Safety and Security domain. Kazakhstan's political terror scale score fell to three, indicating that political persecution and human rights abuses had become widespread. There were also smaller deteriorations in the homicide rate and police rate, and a very small increase in the number of refugees and IDPs as a percentage of the population.

Despite ranking last in the region and 11th lowest globally, Russia has recorded improvements across all three GPI domains, with its score improving by 1.3 per cent. There have been substantial reductions in the police rate and the homicide rate, with the latter falling from over 20 per 100,000 to less than ten per 100,000 in  the last decade. However, political instability continues to be an issue in Russia. In March 2020, President Vladimir Putin proposed an amendment to the constitution which will effectively reset his

presidential term to zero, allowing him two more terms in office. Although the outbreak of Covid-19 has led Putin to postpone the referendum, it will likely have a significant impact on Russia's political climate once the pandemic improves.

Azerbaijan and Armenia recorded the first and second largest improvements in peacefulness globally, primarily owing to an improvement in neighbouring countries relations between the two neighbours. The last major open conflict between the two was the 'four-day war' in April 2016, where the dispute over the geographical region of Nagorno-Karabakh led to an estimated
300-500 people killed. The success of the operational ceasefire in 2017-2019 and the so-called 'velvet revolution' in Armenia in 2018 has significantly improved relationships between the two countries.


SOUTH AMERICA
South America had the largest deterioration of any region on the 2020 GPI, with falls in peacefulness on all three GPI domains. Six countries recorded a deterioration in peacefulness, while five countries improved their score. South America is now the fifth most peaceful region in the world, falling behind the neighbouring Central America and the Caribbean region for the first time since 2016. No South American country is currently ranked higher than 35th on the index.

Venezuela is the least peaceful country in the region and is ranked amongst the 15 least peaceful countries in the world. It also had the largest fall in peacefulness in South America, with its overall score deteriorating by 7.5 per cent. Venezuela experienced another year of political and civil unrest, with security forces and riot troops blocking opposition lawmakers and journalists from entering the parliament in January 2020. Violence and resource scarcity has significantly increased the numbers of refugees and internally displaced people in Venezuela and as a consequence, the country has fallen 69 places in the global ranking for this indicator. It is now ranked in the bottom ten in the world, with over ten per cent of the country estimated to be either refugees or internally displaced. Venezuela's commitment to UN peacekeeping funding has also weakened significantly over the past year.

Chile also experienced a turbulent year, which led to it having the second largest deterioration in peacefulness in the region. An increase in the price of metro tickets led to a rise in civil unrest, with mass-protests against inequality erupting in Santiago in October 2019, before spreading around the country. In many instances these protests turned violent, leaving at least 25 people dead. While the unrest has subsided to some extent since the peak in November, sporadic bouts of protests and isolated incidents of violence are likely to continue. These protests led to a deterioration on both the violent demonstrations and intensity of internal conflict indicators.

Colombia faced increasing civil and political unrest over the past year, despite a small overall increase in peacefulness of 0.2 per cent. Over a quarter of a million demonstrators took to the streets in November 2019 to protest cuts to social welfare, with one protestor being killed after being struck by a tear gas canister.
Colombia also had an increase in terrorism impact, a rise in the police rate to 367 police per 100,000 people, and a small rise in the incarceration rate. However, the number of internally displaced people in Colombia fell by almost two percentage points, the homicide rate dropped, and the country's score on the political terror scale indicator also improved.

Ecuador recorded a deterioration in peacefulness of 5.7 per cent in the last year. Like many other countries in the region, Ecuador experienced intense, and at times violent protests. These erupted after the government's long-standing fuel subsidies were cut in October 2019. The capital city Quito recorded high levels of property damage and deliberate disruption of business operations during the demonstrations. Following pressure from indigenous leaders, the government decided to re-introduce the subsidies. As a result, Ecuador recorded a deterioration on the violent demonstrations and political instability indicators over the past year.


SOUTH ASIA
Peacefulness in South Asia deteriorated on the 2020 GPI, owing to falls in peacefulness in Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Afghanistan. The deterioration in peacefulness was driven by changes on the Militarisation and Safety and Security domains. Although it is the second least peaceful region overall, South Asia has one of the widest disparities between its most and least peaceful regions.

overall, while Afghanistan is the least peaceful country on the GPI.

Bhutan is the most peaceful country in South Asia, and is the only country outside of Europe and Asia-Pacific to be ranked in the top 20 of the GPI. However, despite its very high levels of peacefulness, Bhutan had an overall deterioration in score on the 2020 GPI. The number of refugees and IDPs as a percentage of the population increased to 0.92 per cent, and the police rate also increased, to  just over 581 police officers per 100,000 people. Although it is the most peaceful country in the region, Bhutan has a significant  higher police rate than any other South Asian country.

Afghanistan remains the least peaceful country in the region, and the least peaceful country overall on the 2020 GPI. Despite the signing of peace deal between the US and the Taliban in February 2020, violent attacks continued only days after the agreement was signed. In addition, domestic disputes remain over the results of the September 2019 election, with Ashraf Ghani inaugurated as president while rival candidate Abdullah Abdullah held his own swearing-in ceremony. Afghanistan has also experienced the biggest deterioration in the region driven by an increasing homicide rate, growing weapons imports, increasing numbers of refugees and internally displaced people and a weaker commitment to UN peacekeeping funding.

India, the region's most populous country, is ranked fifth in peacefulness in South Asia, and 139th overall. Tensions between different political, ethnic, and religious groups remain a significant threat to peacefulness in the country. With the amendment of the Citizenship Act in December 2019, making it difficult for particularly Muslim minorities to regain citizenship, tensions between Muslims and the Hindu majority have escalated. India   has had a slight increase in the incarceration rate of three per cent and an increase in deaths from internal conflict of 9.9 per cent.
However, there have been some improvements in peacefulness. India's military expenditure as percentage of GDP fell, as did its armed services rate. Its commitment to UN peacekeeping funding also improved significantly.

Bangladesh recorded the region's biggest increase in peacefulness over the last year, with a 2.3 per cent improvement in its overall score. Its score improved across all three domains, with the largest improvement on Safety and Security. The violent demonstrations indicator had the largest single improvement as a result of a fall in the number of protests from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party.
While protests for better working conditions in the readymade garments sector continue, they have remained peaceful so far. Bangladesh also had improvements in deaths from internal conflict, the homicide rate, and terrorism impact.

SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA
Sub-Saharan Africa recorded a slight fall in peacefulness on the 2020 GPI, with an overall score deterioration of 0.5 per cent.
Twenty countries in the region improved in peacefulness while 24 deteriorated. Disputes over election results and demands for political change have led to civil unrest and political instability in several countries across the region, with violent protests breaking out in many countries over the past year.

Despite retaining its place as the least peaceful country in
sub-Saharan Africa, South Sudan made progress toward building the political foundations for peace at the end of the GPI measurement year. In March 2020, the country's feuding leaders, Riek Machar and Salva Kiir, reached a political settlement and formed government, putting an end to more than six years of armed conflict.

The region's three largest improvers in peacefulness in the last year were South Africa, Cote d'Ivoire and Equatorial Guinea, all of which recorded improvements of more than six per cent. Both South Africa and Cote d'Ivoire improved across all three GPI domains, while Equatorial Guinea substantially improved on the Militarisation domain.

Benin experienced the biggest deterioration of any country in the world, falling 34 places in the ranking to 106th on the 2020 GPI. Sporadic clashes erupted across the country following the election in April 2019, in which the opposition party was effectively banned, leading to a deterioration in political instability.

Niger recorded the second largest deterioration in the region. Over the last year, cross-border armed robberies and violent crime by gangs led to a deterioration on the violent crime indicator. Niger ranked 16th highest for entrenched criminality in Africa in the 2019 Africa Organised Crime Index, with a criminality score considerably higher than the continental average. As a consequence, Niger recorded a deterioration in perceptions of criminality in the last year.

Nigeria continues to face challenges on both Safety and Security and Ongoing Conflict domains. The conflict between government forces and Boko Haram in the northeast led to an estimated 640 civilians killed in 2019.8 In addition, Nigeria's problems with cross-border smuggling and imports undercutting local producers have led the government to shut down its borders, causing Nigeria's relationship with neighbouring countries to deteriorate.
Over the last year, the country has recorded further deteriorations in Militarisation and Ongoing Conflict and an overall deterioration in peacefulness of 0.8 per cent.

Economic problems have left the Gambia vulnerable to further deteriorations in peacefulness. With a youth unemployment rate of over 40 per cent, public dissatisfaction and migration have been   on the rise.9 In addition, the country has recorded a rise in police brutality, particularly in clashes with anti-government protesters.10 However, the opening of the Farafenni bridge over the Gambia River in early 2019, reconnecting the Gasamance region in Senegal with the rest of the territory, has eased tensions in the region and led to a de facto truce between the Senegal army and separatist groups. Senegal's level of internal organised conflict has, therefore, improved and the Gambia has had improvements in political instability.

FIVE LARGEST IMPROVEMENTS IN PEACE





CHANGE IN SCORE 2019-20:	CHANGE IN RANK 2019-20:



Azerbaijan recorded the largest improvement in peacefulness on the 2020 GPI, with its score improving by 7.6 per cent, leading to a rise of 12 places in the rankings. The most notable improvement occurred on the Ongoing Conflict domain, which had a 17.6 per cent improvement. However, despite these changes Azerbaijan remains the third least peaceful country in the Russia and Eurasia region, and the 120th most peaceful country overall.

Azerbaijan's improvement on the Ongoing Conflict domain was driven by an improvement in its relationship with its neighbour Armenia. The last significant open conflict between the two countries was in 2016, when the ceasefire was broken and an estimated 300-500 people were killed in the so-called 'four-day war'. After three years of relative peace and an operational ceasefire in 2017-19, the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has stabilised.

A fall in the intensity of the conflict between the two countries also resulted in improvements in the number of internal conflict deaths, internal conflicts fought, and a fall in the number of refugees and IDPs as a percentage of the population, which moved from 4.07 to 3.53 per cent. Weapons imports also fell substantially, with the indicator recording a 25 per cent improvement on the 2020 GPI.

Although the improvement in peacefulness in Azerbaijan was significant, the country still faces several significant obstacles to peace, particularly on the Safety and Security domain. Perceptions of criminality remain high, and the country also has high levels of political instability, and scores poorly on the political terror scale.

CHANGE IN SCORE 2019-20:	CHANGE IN RANK 2019-20:




Armenia had the second largest increase in peacefulness on the 2020 GPI, with only its neighbouring country Azerbaijan having a larger improvement. It rose 15 places in the rankings and is now ranked among the 100 most peaceful countries, owing to a large improvement in relations with neighbouring countries, as well as a substantial fall in its incarceration rate.

The largest improvement occurred on the Ongoing Conflict domain, with improvements in relations with neighbouring countries and a fall in deaths from internal conflict. The primary driver of these changes was an improved relationship with


neighbouring Azerbaijan, helped in part by Armenia's 'velvet revolution', and a stabilisation of the Nagarno-Karabakh conflict.

On the Safety and Security domain, Armenia's incarceration rate improved significantly, falling over 35 per cent over the past three years to 76 prisoners per 100,000 people. This fall means that Armenia now has the lowest incarceration rate in the Russia and Eurasia region. There was also an improvement in its homicide rate, political instability, and a fall in terrorism impact.

Despite these improvements, Armenia did record deteriorations in some indicators. Although political instability improved, it came  at the expense of increasing government interference, resulting in  a deterioration in Armenia's political terror scale score. There was also a deterioration in the Militarisation domain. In contrast to    the improvement in Azerbaijan, weapons imports rose significantly, as did military expenditure as a percentage of GDP.

CHANGE IN SCORE 2019-20:	CHANGE IN RANK 2019-20:




Bahrain had the third highest increase in peacefulness on the 2020 GPI, with a 4.8 per cent improvement in overall score, leading to a rise in the rankings of nine places. This is the third consecutive year of increasing peacefulness in Bahrain, after almost a decade of sustained deteriorations in peacefulness. It is now the eighth most peaceful country in the Middle East and North Africa region.

The improvement in peacefulness in Bahrain was driven by changes in just a small number of indicators, most notably access to small arms and the intensity of internal conflict. Although private gun ownership is quite high in Bahrain, it has halved on a per capita basis over the past few years. Moreover, the laws on firearms possession are quite tight including licensing only for those over the age of 21 for both firearms and ammunition.

With respect to the intensity of internal conflict, tensions remain between the Sunni ruling minority and the Shia majority who feel under represented. However, the authorities have tightened security and the number of incidents of violent protest has fallen sharply over the past. Figures released by the Ministry of the Interior reveal an 86 per cent decline in the number of terrorism- related criminal investigations since their peak in 2014.


CHANGE IN SCORE 2019-20:	CHANGE IN RANK 2019-20:



South Africa had the fourth highest overall improvement in peacefulness in the 2020 GPI. Its overall score improved by 3.4 per cent, which saw it rise three places to be ranked 123rd overall, with improvements in all three GPI domains. However, despite this improvement, South Africa still faces many challenges to peace, especially in the Safety and Security domain. In particular, it has a very high homicide rate, and very high levels of violent crime.


South Africa's biggest improvement was in the political terror scale indicator, where its score moved from a four to a three. This suggests that while political violence and human rights abuses in the country remain common, the scope and intensity of these abuses has been reduced. South Africa's incarceration rate also improved, falling from 286 to 275 prisoners per 100,000 people.
South Africa has the fourth highest incarceration rate in sub- Saharan Africa, ahead of only Namibia, Rwanda, and Eritrea.

South Africa improved on several indicators in the Militarisation domain. Its commitment to timely UN peacekeeping funding improved, and the number of both weapons imports and weapons exports fell. However, South Africa is still the largest weapons exporter per capita in the sub-Saharan region, and is ranked 30th for per capita weapons exports overall.

FIVE LARGEST DETERIORATIONS IN PEACE





CHANGE IN SCORE 2019-20:	CHANGE IN RANK 2019-20:







CHANGE IN SCORE 2019-20:	CHANGE IN RANK 2019-20:




Honduras had the fifth largest improvement in peacefulness on   the 2020 GPI, rising four places in the rankings with a 3.1 per cent increase in its overall score. It recorded improvements across all three GPI domains, and had particularly noticeable improvements on the political terror scale and deaths from internal conflict indicators.

Honduras has suffered from some of the highest rates of internal conflict and interpersonal violence in the world over the past decade. However, the level of conflict has steadily declined over the past five years. As the activities of criminal gangs in Honduras have begun to subside, the homicide rate has fallen steadily, and deaths from internal conflict fell to zero. The political terror scale indicator improved, suggesting that government repression related to internal conflict has now lessened, and there was also a fall in the number of terrorist attacks and deaths from terrorism.
However, both the police rate and incarceration rate have risen over the past few years.

Despite these improvements, there are still many sources of potential conflict and tension within Honduras. It has the fourth highest homicide rate in the world, despite a 26 per cent fall in the number of homicides in 2017. The political tensions surrounding internal conflict and migration flows threaten to sour relations  with the US, and it still has very high levels of violent crime, with concordantly high perceptions of criminality.





Benin had the largest deterioration in peacefulness of any country on the 2020 GPI, falling 35 places in the rankings.



Benin had the largest deterioration in peacefulness of any country on the 2020 GPI, falling 35 places in the rankings to 106th, owing to an 11.3 per cent deterioration in overall score. Benin had deteriorations across all three GPI domains, with the largest occurring on the Ongoing Conflict domain.

The intensity of internal conflict indicator had the largest overall deterioration. Sporadic clashes have continued in Benin in 2019-20 since legislative elections were held in April 2019 from which opposition parties were barred. Benin's former president, Thomas Boni Yayi, went into exile last year after being held under de-facto house arrest by Benin's current leader, Patrice Talon. The absence of the opposition in the legislative vote has provoked unrest, with violent protests breaking out across the country, including in the capital, Porto Novo, in the south, and in Tchaourou and Kilibo in the centre of the country.

Benin's relations with neighbouring countries also deteriorated over the past year. Nigeria has closed its border with Benin in an attempt to cut down rice smuggling from its smaller neighbour. Despite talks to resolve the situation, the border continues to be shut to trade.

CHANGE IN SCORE 2019-20:	CHANGE IN RANK 2019-20:




Nicaragua had the second largest fall in peacefulness of any country, falling 15 places as a result of deteriorations in the Ongoing Conflict and Safety and Security domains. This fall continues the trend of deteriorating peacefulness that began two years ago. Nicaragua is now the least peaceful country in the Central America and the Caribbean region, and the 135th most peaceful country overall.

Nicaragua's deterioration in peacefulness has been driven by protests against social security reforms that begun in 2018. The fallout from the government response to the protests has led to a deterioration on the political terror scale indicator, with Nicaragua's score moving from 2.5 to four. Political activists have been targeted for violent harassment, with hundreds of protestors allegedly tortured by the government.

Nicaragua also recorded a significant deterioration on the violent crime indicator, stemming from the actions of illegal paramilitary

groups. These groups have caused major disruptions to businesses since the onset of the political crisis in 2018. According to the main agricultural producers' association, as of April 2019 3,300 hectares of agricultural land remains illegally occupied by these groups.

The crisis of the past two years has also had a flow-on effect to a number of indicators of Safety and Security. There was a further deterioration on the political instability indicator, as the US government approved the Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality Act (NICA), which authorises the US executive branch to impose sanctions on Nicaraguans deemed to have committed human  rights abuses or acts of corruption. This development has come at the time when the Organisation of American States is preparing to ramp up diplomatic and economic pressures against Nicaragua.

CHANGE IN SCORE 2019-20:	CHANGE IN RANK 2019-20:




Venezuela recorded the third largest deterioration in peacefulness on the 2020 GPI, with an overall score deterioration of 7.5 per cent. This marks the eighth consecutive year that Venezuela's score has deteriorated, with the country dropping from a ranking of 125th in 2012, to 149 on the 2020 GPI. It is now the least peaceful country in South America, a position it has held since 2019.

Venezuela's deterioration in peacefulness occurred primarily on the Safety and Security domain, owing to an increase in the number of refugees and IDPs as a percentage of the population. The 2019 UNHCR mid-year trends report notes that there are over three million Venezuelans displaced abroad, even if the majority  of these have not formally sought asylum in the destination country. Almost half of these displaced Venezuelans are currently residing in Colombia.

The political crisis in Venezuela over the past few years has led to its score on many of the Safety and Security indicators deteriorating. Venezuela now has the maximum possible score of five for violent demonstrations, violent crime, and perceptions of criminality. Although its homicide rate improved from 56 to 49  per 100,000 people, it is still the third highest in the world, behind only Jamaica and El Salvador. However, Venezuela did have a slight improvement on its political terror scale score, an indication that the rule of law in the country has begun to be partially restored, and that the scope of human rights abuses and political repression has somewhat narrowed.

CHANGE IN SCORE 2019-20:	CHANGE IN RANK 2019-20:




Niger recorded the fourth largest deterioration in peacefulness on the 2020 GPI, falling 11 places in the rankings to 138th overall. This continues a trend of falling peacefulness in Niger that began in 2014. Since then, its overall GPI score has deteriorated by over 25

per cent. While Niger experienced deteriorations across all three domains, the decline in Safety and Security was the key driver of its fall in peacefulness.

The perceptions of criminality indicator had the largest deterioration, owing to a steep rise in violence around Niger's borders regions. The decline in security has driven domestic demand for arms, as well as weakening local law enforcement efforts to tackle rampant trafficking in arms, gold, people and drugs, as security forces were preoccupied with combating the threat from terrorism.

The violent crime indicator also deteriorated as a result of increased criminal activity in Niger's border regions. In recent years, gangs involved in cross-border armed robbery and cattle- rustling have emerged in Nigeria, Niger, Chad, Cameroon, Senegal and Mali. Niger also hosts both domestic criminal networks and foreign criminal actors involved in cross-border smuggling networks, particularly in its vast Agadez region, which borders unstable states where law enforcement has weakened, particularly on the border with Libya.

Despite the overall deterioration in peacefulness, Niger did have an improvement on some indicators of Militarisation, with military expenditure, the armed forces rate, and the number of weapons imports all falling over the past year.

CHANGE IN SCORE 2019-20:	CHANGE IN RANK 2019-20:




Chile had the fifth largest deterioration in peacefulness on the 2020 GPI, falling 17 places to now be ranked 45th. It now has its lowest levels of peacefulness since the inception of the GPI.

Chile's deterioration was driven by deteriorations in the Safety and Security domain, most notably an increase in the intensity of internal conflict, violent demonstrations, and a rise in political instability. Mass protests broke out in the capital, Santiago, in October over the hike in metro fares. The protest movement then spread to other parts of the country and quickly transformed into    a nation-wide campaign against inequality and the high cost of living. The movement was characterised by bouts of violence, looting and unrest which resulted in the shutdown of shops and businesses, as well as disruptions to travel and activity. A state of emergency was declared in the early days of the protests and the accompanying violence had resulted in at least 25 deaths by the  end of 2019.

Although Chile recorded signification deteriorations on the Safety and Security and Ongoing Conflict domains, it did record an improvement on the militarisation domain. The armed services  rate and both weapons imports and weapons exports improved. These improvements occurred alongside reforms to end off-budget funding of military expenditure, passed in September 2019.


















TRENDS IN PEACEFULNESS
KEY FINDINGS



j The average level of global peacefulness has deteriorated by 2.5 per cent since 2008. Over that period, 81 countries deteriorated in peacefulness, while 79 improved.
j The average level of country peacefulness has deteriorated for nine of the past 12 years.
j The gap between the least and most peaceful countries continues to grow. Since 2008, the 25 least peaceful countries declined on average by
12.9 per cent, while the 25 most peaceful countries improved by 2.1 per cent.
j While the deterioration in peacefulness has not been limited to any one region, indicator, or country, conflict in the Middle East has been the key driver of the global deterioration in peacefulness.
j Full democracies had a small deterioration in peacefulness of 0.32 per cent. This fall in peacefulness started five years ago, and is reflective of growing political instability and social unrest in Western Europe and North America.
j Of the three GPI domains, two recorded a deterioration while one improved. Ongoing Conflict deteriorated by 6.8 per cent and Safety and Security deteriorated by 3.3 per cent.
However, Militarisation improved by 4.4 per cent.
j The improving trend in Militarisation was not limited to a single region, with 109 of the 163 countries covered in the GPI improving. One

hundred countries reduced their military expenditure as a percentage of GDP, and 113 had a reduction in their armed forces personnel rate.
j The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) remains the world's least peaceful region for the sixth consecutive year. It is less peaceful than the global average for 19 of the 23 GPI indicators.
j Almost half of the countries in Europe, the world's most peaceful region, have deteriorated in peacefulness since 2008.
j The indicator with the largest deterioration globally was the terrorism impact indicator. Ninty-seven countries recorded an increase in terrorist activity since 2008. However, the total
number of deaths from terrorism has been falling globally since 2014, and is now lower than at any point in the last decade.
j The homicide rate indicator had the largest improvement, with 123 countries improving since the 2008 GPI. There was also a notable improvement on the political terror scale indicator, with 47 countries improving on political terror and human rights abuses, while 33 deteriorated.
j Although deaths from conflict rose 170 per cent between the 2008 and 2020 GPI, they have been declining every year since peaking in 2014.
Deaths from conflict have halved since their peak of 104,555.




The world is considerably less peaceful now than it was in 2008, with the average level of country peacefulness deteriorating by 2.5 per cent over the last decade. Peacefulness has declined year-on-year for nine of the last 12 years. Since 2008, 81 countries have become less peaceful, compared to 79 that have improved. Figure 2.1 highlights the overall trend in peacefulness from 2008 to 2020, as well as the year-on- year percentage change in score.



Most of the deterioration in peacefulness over the last decade occurred in the MENA region. If this region was excluded from the analysis, the average level of peace would only have deteriorated by one per cent, and if the flow-on effects from conflict in the Middle East, such as increases in terrorism and forced migration had not changed, then the world would have become more peaceful.

Even within the MENA region, the deterioration in the last decade was concentrated in a handful of countries, most notably Syria, Yemen and Libya, which all had score deteriorations of more than 40 per cent. However, although there has been relatively little variation in peacefulness outside of MENA, there are some concerning trends in the more peaceful regions of the world.

The 25 most peaceful improved by an average 2.1 per cent over the last decade.

While there has been some fluctuation in  the  level  of peacefulness of the world's most peaceful countries, there was an overall improvement in peacefulness of 2.1 per cent. By contrast, the world's least peaceful countries have experienced a clear and sustained deterioration in peacefulness over the last decade, with the average level of peacefulness deteriorating by almost 13 per cent.

The changes in peacefulness also varied considerably by government type, as shown in Figure 2.3. In countries classified as authoritarian regimes, peacefulness deteriorated the
most. However, there were also significant deteriorations in peacefulness amongst hybrid regimes, which have a mix of democratic and authoritarian tendencies. Amongst countries classified as democratic, those classified as flawed democracies had an average increase in peacefulness, while full democracies had a small deterioration in peacefulness. This fall in peacefulness amongst full democracies started five years ago, and is reflective of growing political instability and social unrest in Western Europe and North America.

GPI Domain Trends


The GPI measures peacefulness across three domains: Safety and Security, Ongoing Conflict and Militarisation. While the world has become less peaceful over the last decade, there have been some notable improvements in peace. The average country score on the Militarisation domain improved by 4.4 per cent, driven largely by reductions in military spending as a percentage of GDP and the size of the armed forces
in many countries. The Safety and Security domain deteriorated by 3.3 per cent and the Ongoing Conflict domain also deteriorated, falling by 6.8 per cent, as shown in Figure 2.4.



The change in the three GPI domains has varied not only by region, but also by government type. Figure 2.5 shows the indexed trend for each of the three domains across the four government types identified by the Economist Intelligence Unit's (EIU) Democracy Index.

The greatest difference between government types occurs in the Ongoing Conflict domain. The vast majority of the increase in active armed conflict over the past decade has taken place in authoritarian regimes, located for the most part in MENA and
sub-Saharan Africa. Trends across the other two domains are more stable, with all four government types having deteriorated on the Safety and Security domain, albeit only marginally for flawed democracies, while all four government types improved on the Militarisation domain.

Figure 2.6 shows the percentage change in score for each indicator from the 2008 to the 2020 GPI. Of the 23 GPI indicators, 15


recorded a deterioration with the remaining eight recording an improvement. Only two indicators had an overall change of more than 20 per cent. The terrorism impact indicator deteriorated by
21.2 per cent, and the UN peacekeeping funding indicator improved by 20.4 per cent.



The greatest difference between government types occurs in the Ongoing Conflict domain.

SAFETY & SECURITY
The Safety and Security domain deteriorated 3.3 per cent between 2008 and 2020. Of the 11 domain indicators, nine deteriorated, with the largest number of countries deteriorating on the terrorism impact indicator. The homicide rate indicator had the largest improvement, with 123 countries recording an improvement. The refugees and IDPs indicator had the most significant change, with the total number of refugees and internally displaced people increasing from just under 25 million in 2008, to over 65 million in 2019. Figure 2.7 shows the trend for these three key indicators on the Safety and Security domain.

Figure 2.7 highlights the extent to which terrorism has increased over the past decade, with deaths from terrorism rising from 8,374 in 2008 to just under 33,555 in 2014. However, preliminary estimates for 2019 indicate that deaths from terrorism have now dropped to less than 8,000. The fall in deaths from terrorism has been mainly driven by the military defeat of ISIL in Iraq and Syria and the military interventions against Boko Haram in Nigeria.
Terrorism has also been spreading around the globe. In the   2008 GPI, 48 countries had not experienced any terrorism in the preceding five years. By the 2020 GPI, that number had dropped to 30.

The homicide rate indicator had the largest improvement of any Safety and Security indicator over the past decade. Despite a considerable increase in the homicide rate of some Central
American countries, 124 reduced their homicide rate since 2008. There are now 27 countries globally that have a homicide rate of less than one per 100,000 people, and 58 which have a rate under two per 100,000.

Despite the improvements in homicide, terrorism, and other indicators of Safety and Security over the past five years, the number of refugees and IDPs has continued to climb, and has risen almost every year since 2008. There are now over 22 million refugees from conflict situations around the world, with many millions of additional people currently seeking asylum or in refugee-like situations. This represents a 116 per cent increase since 2008.

The number of internally displaced people has risen at an even more dramatic rate, with a 204 per cent increase in the number of IDPs since 2008. Latest estimates suggest that almost 43 million people across the world are currently internally displaced. There


are ten countries in which over a million people are displaced, with the highest total number of displaced people in Colombia and Syria.

When measured as a percentage of the population, there are now 15 countries where at least five per cent of the population are either refugees or internally displaced. Somalia and the
Central African Republic both have more than 20 per cent of their population displaced, while South Sudan has over 37 per cent of its population displaced. However, the extent of displacement is greatest in Syria, where the impact and aftermath of the Syrian civil war led to just under three quarters of the entire population being either internally displaced or refugees at the end of the war.
ONGOING CONFLICT
Ongoing Conflict had the largest deterioration of any domain on the GPI, deteriorating by 6.8 per cent between 2008 and 2020. Five of the six Ongoing Conflict indicators deteriorated, with only deaths from external conflict recording an improvement. In total, 80 countries recorded a deterioration on this domain, with 61 recording an improvement since 2008. Figure 2.8 shows the trend for three key conflict indicators: the total number of battle deaths, total number of conflicts, and the average score on the intensity of internal conflict indicator.

The indicator with the most notable variation in the past few years on the Ongoing Conflict domain has been the increase and then  fall in the number of conflict deaths (both internal and external). Battle related deaths rose by 265 per cent between 2008 and the peak in 2014. It then subsequently halved from 2015 to 2019.

The dramatic increase was concentrated in a handful of countries, with the majority of the deaths being attributable to the war in Syria. There were also significant increases in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Yemen.

The largest fall in deaths occurred in Syria, however, Nigeria, Pakistan, Iraq, and the Central African Republic also had significant decreases over this time. Afghanistan is one of the few countries where the number of deaths has not decreased over the past few years, with the scope and intensity of the conflict there actually increasing since 2014. Afghanistan is now the country with the highest total number of deaths from internal conflict.

While the number of deaths from conflict has been declining since 2015, the total number of conflicts has continued to rise, from
104 in 2008 to 160 in 2018. This includes state-based violence, non-state violence (conflict between two armed groups within  a country, neither of which is a state), and one-sided violence (the organized use of armed force by the state against civilians,
excluding extra-judicial killings). While the number of one-sided conflicts remained relatively constant, both state-based and non- state conflicts increased significantly. State-based conflicts rose from 38 to 52, while non-state violent conflicts increased over 100 per cent, rising from 36 in 2008 to 76 in 2018.

The average intensity of internal conflict has also been rising,  even as the total number of deaths from internal conflict has been declining across the world. Although this may seem contradictory, the countries with the highest intensity conflicts, such as Syria, improved substantially, whereas the number of low intensity conflicts increased globally.

The average intensity of internal conflict indicator score increased from 2.29 to 2.52. A score of one on this indicator for a single country indicates that there is no conflict. A score of two indicates that there is a strong ideological conflict within that country,  while a score of three indicates open conflict, with the existence
of explicit threats of violence between different groups in that country. In 2008, 104 countries had a score of two or less on this

indicator, suggesting no conflict or only latent conflict. By 2020, this number had fallen to 88. The number of countries with a score of at least three or worse rose from 57 in 2008, to 74 in 2020.
MILITARISATION
The Militarisation domain was the only one of the three GPI domains to have an improvement. The average score on this domain improved by 4.4 per cent between 2008 and 2020, with 109 countries recording an improvement and 52 deteriorating. Five of the six indicators on the Militarisation domain improved. The most noticeable improvements occurred on the military expenditure indicator, where 100 countries improved, and the armed forces rate indicator, where 113 countries improved.
Figure 2.9 shows the trend for the armed forces rate and military expenditure indicators, as well as the total number of weapons imports from 2003 to 2020.

The improvement in both the armed forces rate and military expenditure was particularly notable in some of the largest militaries in the world. Of the five countries with the largest total military expenditure - United States, China, Saudi Arabia, India, and Russia - all five had falls in their armed service personnel rates, and China, India, and the US also had a concurrent reduction in military expenditure as a percentage of GDP.

From 2008 to 2020, the average armed forces rate fell from 463 to 405 soldiers per 100,000 people.

Military expenditure as a percentage of GDP improved in 100 countries between 2008 and 2020. It improved on average for five of the nine regions globally, with the biggest average improvement occurring in the Asia-Pacific Region. The largest increase by region occurred in the Middle East and North Africa and South Asia, where average military expenditure as a percentage of GDP rose 1.07 percentage points from 2008 to 2020.

While military expenditure has fallen on average as a percentage of GDP, it has risen on an absolute and per capita basis. Total global military spending rose from 1.577 trillion in 2008 to 1.78 trillion in 2018 (measured in constant $US 2017 dollars), an increase of 12.9 per cent.

There was a slight deterioration in both the weapons exports

indicators to show a deterioration over the past decade. The total value of weapons imports rose by 12.6 per cent between 2008 and 2019. The GPI uses a five year moving average of these values to calculate the scores for the weapons imports and weapons exports indicators.

Weapons exports remain highly concentrated, with 73 countries registering no exports at all for the period 2003 to 2019. A number of otherwise highly peaceful countries also performed poorly on this indicator, with Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the Netherlands all being ranked amongst the ten highest weapons exporters per capita for every year in the last five
years. Seven of the ten largest exporters on a per capita basis are western democracies. However, by total export value, just five countries account for over 75 per cent of total weapons exports: the US, Russia, Germany, France, and China, with the US alone accounting for over 32 per cent.

BOX 2.1
Defining Civil Unrest


IEP has used the Cross National Time Series (CNTS) dataset to analayze the global trends in civil unrest. The CNTS data includes a conservative count of riots, general strikes, and anti-government demonstrations for 200 countries. CNTS gives the following definitions for the variables used in this section:

Riots: Any violent demonstration or clash of more than 100 citizens involving the use of physical force.

General strikes: Any strike of 1,000 or more industrial or service workers that involves more than one employer and that is aimed at national government policies or authority.

Anti-government demonstrations: Any peaceful public gathering of at least 100 people for the primary purpose of displaying or voicing their opposition to government policies or authority, excluding demonstrations of a distinctly anti-foreign nature.

INTRODUCTION
The number of protest movements and demonstrations has increased across the world since 2011. In most situations, these movements avoid violence, however, both violent and nonviolent demonstrations have become increasingly frequent over the last decade. Seven of the nine GPI regions had increased levels of civil unrest, with the most violence recorded in places where democratic institutions were weak.

In recent months the world's governments faced an urgent imperative to restrict movement in order to contain COVID-19. In March and April 2020, demonstrations abated significantly as stay-at-home orders were enforced around the world. However, the economic shock that will follow the lockdowns are likely to lead to increases in civil unrest.
2019: YEAR OF THE PROTEST
2019 was characterised by increases in protests across the world. France, Chile, Mexico, Hong Kong, and elsewhere had large protests, often resulting in violence. Most civil unrest around the world takes the form of nonviolent protests, but at least 58 per cent of GPI countries experienced violent protests in 2019.

The year opened with ongoing, daily demonstrations in both France and Sudan. France's Mouvement des gilets jaunes, or Yellow Vests Movement held near constant demonstrations, often leading to clashes with police. Sudanese demonstrators held demonstrations for at least eight months, demanding a democratic transition, which helped lead to a coup d'etat against President Omar al-Bashir.

The Algerian military also deposed President Abdelaziz Bouteflika in response to the demands of protestors, ending his 20 year presidency in April of 2019. By the end of the year, both Iraq's President Barham Salih and Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi had resigned in response to mass mobilizations. Bolivia's army supported protestors in demanding the resignation of President  Evo Morales after alleged fraud in the 2018 presidential election. Lebanese Prime Minister Saad Hariri also resigned. In Egypt,

weeks of protests across the country calling for President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi's resignation were met with government force and mass arrests.

By January 2020, Iranians had called for the resignation of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, after months of unrest sparked by a rise in fuel prices.1 Price hikes triggered movements in many countries last year. Chileans reacted to an increase in Santiago subway fares with civil disobedience and riots, with the movement eventually growing to call for a new constitution.
COVID-19: UNREST CONTINUES IN 2020
As COVID-19 spread across the globe, governments imposed sweeping restrictions on movement in order to contain the pandemic. The pandemic and resulting government responses have reduced protests around the world. Figure 2.10 gives the trend in daily riots and protests recorded by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), which covers most of the world except for the US, Canada and countries in Oceania.

There was a small spike in March of 2020 and then a sharp decline in April. Civil unrest declined nearly 90 per cent from 11 March to 11 April 2020.

Student groups and civil organizations in Chile called for a suspension of protests in late March, but citizens also set up road blockades in actions calling for regional lockdowns and improved safety protocols.3 Demonstrations also declined in Colombia and Venezuela with the imposition of lockdowns.4 The restrictions were announced as indefinite in seven states in Venezuela.

Russia and Eurasia also had significantly reduced activity as measures to limit the spread of coronavirus led to the cancellation of most public events. Moscow and Chechnya faced complete lockdown and protests across Russia were either reduced or cancelled.

Restrictions on movement may dampen protest activity in the short run, but political and social tensions are likely to remain through the crisis. Some will be amplified, as frustrations are compounded by the economic downturn and food shortages in the wake of the pandemic.

TRENDS IN CIVIL UNREST
Protest movements and civil unrest had been on the rise for the previous decade, as shown in Figure 2.11. In the eight years leading up to 2018, the available comparable global data shows a 102 per cent increase in the number of riots, general strikes and anti- government demonstrations.

The number of both protests and riots roughly doubled, while the number of general strikes quadrupled, from 33 events in 2011 to 135 in 2018.

government, while Brazilians protested government corruption, calling for the impeachment of then-President Dilma Rousseff. In the United States, more than 1,000 people were arrested in the nation's capitol that year in protests focusing on police violence, gun violence, and environmental issues.
TRENDS BY REGION
Every region of the world has experienced hundreds of civil unrest events over the last ten years, as shown in Figure 2.12. The two regions with the largest increases in civil unrest were sub-Saharan Africa and Europe, although the vast majority of incidences in Europe were non-violent.

The global increase was driven by rises in seven out of nine regions. Only MENA had fewer protests, riots and strikes in 2018, when compared to 2011, while levels in North America were stable. Sub-Saharan Africa had the greatest increase, followed by

Europe, South Asia, South America, Central America and the Caribbean, Asia-Pacific and Russia and Eurasia.

The MENA region had the most significant decline in violent demonstrations, with total unrest falling by 60 percent and the number of riots falling by 50 per cent from 2011 to 2018. North America had fewer riots over the period, recording a decline of 27 per cent

Sub-Saharan Africa
Civil unrest in sub-Saharan Africa rose by more than 800 per cent, from 32 riots and protests in 2011 to 292 in 2018. The increase was mostly driven by events occurring after 2015. Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest proportion of violent demonstrations, with riots making up 42.6 per cent of total events.

Nigeria accounted for the largest number of demonstrations and the largest increase. In 2018 the number of demonstrations rose from six to 79 in a single year. Perhaps the most prominent issue was the imprisonment of Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zakzaky, leader of the

Sixty-four per cent were nonviolent demonstrations and another six per cent were general strikes, with the remaining 30 per cent classified as riots. More than 4,700 nonviolent demonstrations were recorded, compared to nearly 2,200 riots.

The high level of civil unrest in 2011 reflects the Arab Spring, followed by a decline in the number of protests in 2012 as these movements either achieved their goals, were repressed by governments, or escalated into civil wars. However, total global civil unrest rose above 2011 levels just three years later and has remained above that level since.

Riots did not decline in the years immediately following the Arab Spring, when the number of anti-government demonstrations fell. The number of riots around the world has increased 282 per cent since 2011. The trend peaked in 2014, especially in countries with fragile democratic institutions, before plateauing. Since 2016, there have been at least 300 events every year.

Protests peaked globally in 2016, as unrest continued to escalate in many countries but violent demonstrations fell off. Teachers, parents, labourers and municipal workers protested in India, which had nearly 150 different demonstrations. Proposed changes to France's labour laws brought demonstrations and a no- confidence vote for then-President Franois Hollande's

Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN).6 Supporters of the IMN protested repeatedly throughout the year to call for Zakzaky's release, who had been imprisoned since 2015.

In South Africa, there was an 86 per cent increase in civil unrest from 2011 to 2018, with most of the increase occurring in 2017 and 2018. University students began protesting following proposed tuition increases in late 2015. These demonstrations led to the temporary closure of the country's top universities.

Ethiopia experienced a similar trend, as emergency restrictions to contain protests in 2015 expired in late 2017 and citizens returned to the streets. The number of riots and demonstrations rose 500 per cent from 2015 to 2018. Much of the unrest occurred in Oromiya state, which surrounds the capital Addis Ababa and reflected long-standing tensions between the province and the federal government. Demonstrations and other ongoing violence led to the resignation of then-Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn in February of 2018.

In Guinea, protestors and government forces clashed frequently over the last few years, with violence reported in 65 per cent of the demonstrations. Most of the events took place in 2018, as
teacher-led protests eventually secured a promised pay increase from the government.7 At the same time, local political parties marched to demand that the results of municipal elections be released, alleging fraud on the part of the ruling party.8 Protests and riots have continued since 2018, as President Alpha Conde

held a referendum on 22 March 2020 to change the constitution and allow himself a third term in office, sparking further protests that resulted in at least 30 deaths.9

Europe
Europe had the largest number of protests, riots and strikes, with nearly 1,600 events from 2011 to 2018. Sixty-five per cent of incidents of civil unrest in Europe were nonviolent anti- government demonstrations, while 28 per cent were classed as riots and 7.5 per cent were general strikes. Greece, the UK, France, Spain and Turkey each had more than 100 incidents.

Greece had the highest level of unrest, with over 200 events over the period. The country averaged 26 protests, riots or strikes each year. However, civil unrest as a whole declined 23 per cent from 2011 to 2018 as the country started to recover from the Global Financial Crisis.

The UK had 175 civil unrest events from 2011 to 2018. Civil unrest in the country peaked in 2015, following a rise in violent

demonstrations. Total unrest has declined since then, but the UK had more than 30 protests each year from 2015 to 2017.

In France, riots peaked in 2014, but protests surged again two years later in 2016. The country had moderate levels of unrest from 2016 to 2018, which increased again with the Yellow Vests Movement, which began its public demonstrations on 17 November 2018. The protests were still ongoing in France at the time of writing. The widespread movement follows a decade of political and economic unrest in the country.

In Spain, civil unrest spiked in 2012 and again in 2018. The province of Catalonia declared independence in October 2017, following demonstrations, a general strike, and a political
stand-off with Madrid. The declaration was followed by protests and counter-protests for and against the movement. Unrest has continued into 2020, following the arrest and conviction of Catalan independence leaders charged with sedition and other crimes.10

Unrest in Turkey peaked in 2014, a year following the Gezi Park occupation. Beyond demonstrations in Istanbul, riots broke out as demonstrators in Kurdish cities called on the Turkish government to intervene on behalf of Kurdish Syrians besieged by ISIS on Turkey's border.11 Turkey views Syrian Kurds as aligned with Kurdish separatists in Turkey.12 Riots declined afterwards, but nonviolent demonstrations peaked in 2016, in the same year a coup attempt against President Tayyip Recep Erdogan led to protests, at first in support of the government, and then against Erdogan's emergency security measures.13

South Asia
South Asia also experienced high levels of civil unrest over the period, with events peaking in 2016. South Asia had the third highest number of demonstrations over the period. However, Bhutan was the only country in South Asia and one of just eight globally that recorded no incidents of civil unrest from 2011 to 2018.

India had the largest number of events over the decade, with more than 800 protests, riots and strikes recorded from 2011 to 2018.
Civil unrest in India peaked in 2017, but every year from 2015 to 2018 had upwards of 100 events. India had the largest number of general strikes in the world, totalling 90. Over the entire period, only 21 per cent of all events were violent, but the country did see 50 riots in 2017.

Pakistan had the second highest number of incidents, at 165. Seventy-five per cent of these were nonviolent. More than 50 anti-government demonstrations took place in 2016, but civil unrest has fallen 64 per cent since then.

South America
Civil unrest in South America increased from a handful of events in 2011 to over 100 across the continent in 2018. Unrest in the region peaked in 2014, driven by the high number of events in Venezuela that year. South America had the second highest rate of violent demonstrations, at 34.6 per cent of total events.

Venezuela recorded the most civil unrest in South America over the period, with 126 riots, protests or general strikes. The country's economic and political crisis has led to protests over elections, shortages, violence in the country, and in support for and against President Nicolas Maduro's government.

Brazil, which had upward of 100 events over the period, also saw significant unrest in 2014, but the highest number of events was recorded in 2016, at 32. Millions of Brazilians demonstrated against corruption in the country over the course of the decade. In response to the demands of demonstrators in 2013, President Dilma Rousseff introduced anti-corruption and legal reforms that made it possible for prosecutors to investigate corruption.14 Three years later the money laundering investigation Operation Car Wash exposed over $5 billion in illegal payments to company executives and political parties.15 The sweeping investigation caused a political crisis, against a backdrop of economic downturn, and provoked demonstrations from March 2015 to July 2016.

Chile recorded 90 civil unrest events over the period. This unrest continued in to 2019. Mass protests broke out in the capital, Santiago, in October over the hike in metro fares. The protest movement then spread to other parts of the country and quickly transformed into a nation-wide campaign against inequality. The movement was characterised by bouts of violence, looting and

unrest which resulted in the shutdown of shops and businesses, as well as disruptions to travel and activity. A state of emergency was declared in the early days of the protests and the accompanying violence had resulted in at least 25 deaths by end of 2019.

Central America and the Caribbean
Central America and the Caribbean had relatively low levels of civil unrest, with only the Russia and Eurasia region reporting fewer events. However, the number of incidents did rise over the past decade. In 2011, Haiti was the only country to record an incident of civil unrest, as demonstrators protested election inconsistencies in April of that year.16 By 2018, nine out of 12 countries were facing civil unrest, amounting to nearly 100 events in the region that year.

Nicaragua recorded the largest increase over the total period, rising from zero events in 2011 to 27 in 2018. Protests against social security reforms resulted in clashes with the police in April of 2018, and conflict between the government and opposition escalated over the following year. At least 325 people were killed and more than 700 people were imprisoned.17 The protest movement expanded into broader demonstrations against Daniel Ortega's presidency, demanding political reforms and the holding of early elections.

Mexico had the largest number of incidents over the period, with
85. A third of these took place in 2014, the year that 43 teaching students went missing in the state of Guerrero. The local mayor was implicated in collusion with organized crime, but despite the efforts of international teams of forensic investigators, the mass disappearance remains unsolved.

Asia-Pacific
Asia-Pacific recorded a 50 per cent rise in unrest from 2011 to 2018, but levels at the end of the period were down from the peak in  2016. China faced the most civil unrest in the region, accounting for 37.6 per cent of the 619 events. Outside of China, Asia-Pacific countries averaged about 21 demonstrations each from 2011 to 2018. No other country had more than 50 over the period.

As of 2018, events in China were down 50 per cent compared to 2011, with most of the drop off occurring in the last two years of the data. This is likely due to the strict controls introduced in Xinjiang Province since 2017, including the mass internment of Uighur Muslims and other ethnic minorities in the region. Unrest erupted in Xinjiang as early as 2014 - the same year that the Umbrella Revolution emerged in Hong Kong.

Russia and Eurasia
The Russia and Eurasia region had the least unrest over the period, recording just under 300 events from 2011 to 2018. A third of these, or 93 demonstrations and one strike, took place in Russia. A further 25 per cent were in Ukraine, with about half of Ukraine's 74 events occurring in 2014.

Moldova had the next highest total number, at 29, with all of them occurring since 2015. Roughly 10,000 demonstrators in May of that year called on the government to advance reforms that would   bring the country closer to the EU, including investigating $1 billion in missing funds.18

North America
The number of incidents in North America remained steady between 2008 and 2018 with the region averaging 64 incidences per year. North America consists of the US and Canada, which had 469 and 45 events respectively.

Unrest in Canada occurred mostly in 2017 and 2018. Indigenous Canadians staged demonstrations on the country's 150th anniversary, while protestors in Ottawa protested for months when plans for a Salvation Army shelter brought the country's homelessness problem to the fore. Environmental issues were the main theme in 2018, when protestors in Montreal, Calgary, and Vancouver stood against the expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline.

In the US, the number of civil unrest incidents rose slightly in 2015, but the single largest demonstration was the 2017 women's march. Demonstrations against police violence, particularly  against African-Americans led to the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, with incidences peaking in 2015.

Middle East & North Africa
MENA had the second highest number of events, after Europe, with the majority of the riots and protests occurring during the Arab Spring in 2011. MENA was the only world region to record a decline in civil unrest, with the number of demonstrations falling 60 per cent from 2011 to 2018. Nonviolent anti-government demonstrations declined by 68.9 per cent, while riots fell by half. Most of the decline occurred in 2012.

In 2011, 17 countries out of 20 had some level of civil unrest, with Syria, Yemen, Egypt, Bahrain and Tunisia recording the largest number of riots, protests or general strikes. Only Qatar, Palestine,

and the UAE were without major events, although authorities in Palestine and the UAE detained activists and dispersed demonstrations.19

Despite the crises and civil wars that followed many movements, the majority of civil unrest in MENA during 2011 was nonviolent. Violent demonstrations were highest in Egypt in 2011, with 36 per cent of events in Egypt that year involving violence.

Events continued throughout the region in 2012. However, by 2013, civil unrest had fallen 70 per cent. The largest decline was in Syria, which had 81 events in 2011, 33 in 2012 and just one in 2013 as the Syrian Revolution gave way to the Syrian Civil War.

The decline in demonstrations in MENA reflects the so-called Arab Winter. Leaders in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen were deposed or forced to step down by 2012, but only Tunisia avoided civil war, and all four countries were affected by the various conflicts in the region, including the war against ISIL. While the same volume of demonstrations was no longer possible, the region continued to average roughly 129 events per year through 2018.

Demonstrations in Egypt took many years to subside, while civil unrest rose and fell in Lebanon, and has hit Tunisia sporadically throughout the decade. Qatar remained relatively unaffected, and the UAE continued to record no major events.

Authoritarian regimes were the only type of government to register a fall in civil unrest. The largest number of incidences occurred in flawed democracies and hybrid regimes over the period 2011 to 2018. They also had the highest rates of violence, with riots making up 37 per cent of all incidents of unrest in hybrid regime countries.

Civil unrest also increased the most in flawed democracies, followed by hybrid regimes. Figure 2.13 gives the trends in total civil unrest by regime type. Events include riots, general strikes, and nonviolent anti-government demonstrations.

The rate of civil unrest in authoritarian regimes declined 30 per cent from 2011 to 2018, with the sharpest fall occurring during the 2012 Arab Winter. However, the trend rose substantially for the other three government types. The largest increase occurred in flawed democracies, where the rate of demonstrations increased tenfold. Levels nearly quadrupled in hybrid regime countries and nearly doubled in full democracies.

Full democracies had moderate levels of unrest throughout the last decade, averaging 6.5 demonstrations per country per year. Although demonstrations in full democracies are common, they are less likely to be violent and much less likely to lead to major political instability or regime change. Peaceful protests made up
73.6 per cent of events in democracies, while riots and general strikes accounted for 22.3 and 4.1 per cent respectively. Figure 2.15 gives the distribution of events by government type.

ECONOMIC IMPACT OF VIOLENCE
HIGHLIGHTS



j The global economic impact of violence was $14.5 trillion PPP in 2019, equivalent to 10.6 per cent of global GDP or $1,909 per person.
j The global economic impact of violence improved for the second year in a row, decreasing by 0.2 per cent or $29 billion from 2018 to 2019. However, it is $1.25 trillion higher than what is was in 2012.
j The improvement was largely due to the decrease in the impact of Armed Conflict particularly in the Middle East and North Africa region.
j Globally the economic impact of Armed Conflict decreased by 11 per cent or $66 billion in 2019 to $521 billion. This was because of improvements in deaths from terrorism and GDP losses from conflict, which fell by 48 per cent and 21 per cent respectively.
j The major costs associated with Armed Conflict is refugees and displaced persons equating to 64 per cent of the total or
$333 billion.

j Syria, South Sudan and Afghanistan incurred the largest economic cost of violence in 2019 as a percentage of their GDP, equivalent to 60, 57 and 51 per cent of GDP, respectively.
j In the ten countries most economically affected by violence, the average economic cost was equivalent to 41 per cent of GDP. In the ten most peaceful countries the average economic cost was
3.9 per cent of GDP.
j The economic impact of suicide is higher than the economic cost of Armed Conflict, with suicide amounting to $757 billion in 2019, whereas Armed Conflict was $521 billion.
j On average, authoritarian regimes spend 3.7 per cent of GDP on military expenditure. This is 2.3 percentage points more than the average military expenditure of full democracies, which spend 1.4 per cent of GDP on average.

The Economic Value of Peace 2019



The economic impact of violence on the global economy in 2019 amounted to $14.5 trillion in constant purchasing power parity (PPP) terms. This is equivalent to 10.6 per cent of the global GDP or $1,909 per person. In 2019, the economic impact of violence improved for the second year in a row, decreasing by 0.2 per cent or $29 billion.

The economic model contains 16 dimensions, with some of these dimensions containing multiple components, such as internal security expenditure, which consists of police services, law courts, prisons, and other national public safety expenditures.

Violence and the fear of violence create significant economic disruptions. Violent incidents generate costs in the form of property damage, physical injury or psychological trauma. Fear of violence also alters economic behaviour, primarily by changing investment and consumption patterns. Expenditure on preventing and dealing with the consequences of violence divert public and private resources away from productive activities and towards protective measures.

Combined, they generate significant economic losses in the form  of productivity shortfalls, foregone earnings and distorted expenditure. Measuring the scale and cost of violence and violence containment, therefore, has important implications for assessing the effects violence has on economic activity.


TABLE 3.1
Composition of the global economic impact of violence, billions PPP, 2019
Military Expenditure accounts for the highest percentage of the economic impact of violence.



The total economic impact is broken down into three categories: direct costs, indirect costs, and a multiplier effect.

The direct costs associated with violence include the immediate consequences on the victims, perpetrators, and public systems including health, judicial and public safety. The indirect cost of violence refers to longer-term costs such as lost productivity, psychological effects and the impact of violence on the perception of safety and security in society.

The multiplier effect represents the economic benefits that would be generated by the diversion of expenditure away from sunk costs, such as incarceration spending, into more productive alternatives that would better improve the economy. For more details on the peace multiplier refer to Box 3.1 on page 51.

A summary of the methodology is provided at the end of this section and a comprehensive explanation of how the economic impact of violence is calculated is provided in Appendix B.

Table 3.1 presents a full breakdown of the costs included in the 2019 economic impact estimate.

In 2019, reductions in armed conflict underpinned the 0.2 per cent year-on-year decrease in the economic impact of violence. The fall in Armed Conflict in the Middle East and North Africa resulted in positive flow-on effects not only for conflict deaths, but also for the costs associated with refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) and terrorism, all of which fell in 2019.

This is the second year in a row recording a decrease in the economic impact of violence, after five straight years of rising costs. Between 2012 and 2017, the economic impact of violence rose by 10.2 per cent, increasing each year. Consequently, in 2019, the economic impact of violence is $1.25 trillion higher than in 2012. This increase coincided with the start of the Syrian war and rising violence in Libya, Yemen and other parts of the MENA region. The deceases coincided with the defeat of ISIL in both Iraq and Syria, which led to an improvement in the security situation in both countries in the past two years.

Figure 3.1 illustrates the trend in the global economic impact of violence from 2007 to 2019. Table 3.2 presents the trend from 2015 to 2019 for each indicator.

COMPOSITION OF THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF VIOLENCE





Figure 3.2 shows the breakdown of the total economic impact of violence by category. The single largest component was global military expenditure at $5.9 trillion PPP, or 40.5 per cent of the total in 2019. Globally, military expenditure increased by one per cent in 2019, the equivalent of $49.6 billion, however, this increase was primarily driven by increases from the United States, China, and India. In 2019 more countries increased their military expendure as a percentage of GDP, with 81 countries increasing, while 55 countries reduced spending. The $49.6 billion increase in the economic impact of military expenditure was the largest increase of all the indicators.

Internal security expenditure was the second largest component, comprising 34.1 per cent of the global economic impact of violence, at $4.8 trillion. Internal security expenditure includes spending on the police and judicial systems as well as the costs associated with incarceration. The data for internal security spending is obtained from the International Monetary Fund government finance statistics database.

FIGURE 3.2
Breakdown of the global economic impact of violence, 2019
Government spending on the military and internal security comprises almost three-quarters of the global economic impact of violence.

Violent crime, 2.8%
Other, 0.5%
Conflict, 3.6%
Suicide, 5.2%
Homicide, 7.7%

Homicide is the third largest component in the model, at 7.7 per cent and fell by 0.5 per cent in 2019. The fall in the economic impact of homicide has been driven by improvements in many national homicide rates. Russia and the United States both had significant reductions, each recording a $13 billion decline from 2018. However, the improvements in many of the countries were offset by the deterioration in Mexico's impact from homicide which increased by $30 billion, the highest increase of any country.

Suicide, classified as self-inflicted violence resulting in death by the World Health Organisation, is included in the model. The economic impact of suicide amounted to $757.3 billion in 2019 and represents 5.2 per cent of the global total. The economic cost of suicide is higher than that of all of the Armed Conflict indicators combined.

The largest improvement in monetary terms was for the impact of Armed Conflict, which decreased by 11 per cent or $66 billion. The impact of Armed Conflict is consists of five categories:

 Internal and external conflict deaths.
 GDP losses from conflict.
 Country contributions to peacebuilding and peacekeeping.
 Refugees and IDPs.
 Deaths and injuries from terrorism.

All five categories improved from 2018, with the economic impact of terrorism recording the largest percentage improvement, falling by 48 per cent or $14.9 billion. GDP losses and the economic impact of conflict deaths, decreased by 21 per cent and 33 per cent respectively. The economic impact from refugees and IDPs also recorded a decline falling by 5.6 per cent from 2018, the equivalent of $19.4 billion.

The economic impact of violent crime slightly deteriorated in 2019,

      Private security expenditure,

Internal security expenditure, 34.1%

Military expenditure, 40.5%

increasing by 0.1 per cent to $410 billion. Violent crime consists of violent assault and sexual assault, and makes up 2.8 per cent of the total economic impact of violence. The countries that recorded the biggest increases in 2019 were Lesotho, Djibouti and Eritrea, these countries are all located in sub-Saharan Africa and increasd by 11 per cent, six per cent and five per cent respectively.

Expenditure on private security is the fourth largest category in the model and comprises 5.8 per cent of the total.

The purchases of small arms and the economic impact from the
fear of violence and insecurity are categorised as 'Other' in Figure
3.2. In 2019 these indicators accounted for only 0.5 per cent of the total.

THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE, SUICIDE AND ARMED CONFLICT





IEP's model includes domains of both Interpersonal Violence and Self-inflicted Violence, and Armed Conflict. Interpersonal Violence, such as violent assault and homicide are violence committed by individuals or organised criminal activities. Interpersonal and
self-inflicted violence is the aggregate of homicide, violent and sexual assault and suicide. The indicators of Armed Conflict are listed above.
FIGURE 3.3
Composition of the economic impact of Interpersonal Violence and Self-inflicted Violence, 2019
Homicide comprises almost half of the global economic impact of Interpersonal Violence and Self-inflicted Violence.

In 2019, Interpersonal Violence and Self-inflicted Violence amounted to $2.33 trillion. Figure 3.3 provides a detailed breakdown of the economic impact of Interpersonal Violence and Self-inflicted Violence while Figure 3.4 details the breakdown of Armed Conflict.

THE TEN COUNTRIES WITH THE HIGHEST ECONOMIC IMPACT
The economic cost of violence for the ten most affected countries ranges from 24 to 60 per cent of their GDP. These countries have high levels of armed conflict, large numbers of internally displaced persons, high levels of interpersonal violence or large militaries.
Table 3.3 lists the ten most affected countries as a percentage of GDP.
TABLE 3.3

High-intensity conflict-affected countries, such as Syria, South Sudan, Afghanistan, Somalia and the Central African Republic, suffer from higher costs from conflict deaths, terrorism, losses from refugees and IDPs and GDP losses from conflict. Additionally, Iraq and Sudan - countries affected by medium-intensity conflict - suffer similar conflict costs, in particular, losses from refugees and IDPs. Venezuela is affected by high institutional and social fragility and in terms of GDP suffered the largest percentage cost from homicide globally, equal to 32 per cent of its GDP.

THE REGIONAL ECONOMIC IMPACT OF VIOLENCE
Regionally, Asia-Pacific recorded the highest economic impact at
$3,399 billion in 2019. Asia-Pacific's high economic impact was due to the high levels of expenditure on internal security and the military, which in 2019 made up 82 per cent of the region's total economic impact. Asia-Pacific also has the largest population of all regions. Table 3.4 displays the military expenditure in the
Asia-Pacific by country.

Similarly, in North America, internal security and military expenditure comprise 80 per cent of the region's economic impact.


Figure 3.5 displays the total 2019 economic impact by region and the percentage change in the economic impact from 2018. In 2019, four regions improved - MENA, Middle East and North Africa in the listed regions recorded the largest improvement from 2018, declining by 6.5 per cent. The improvement in MENA was driven by the reduction in Armed Conflict which fell by 25.6 per cent.

In 2019, the economic impact deteriorated in five regions. Central America and the Caribbean suffered the largest increase, however, it is also the region with the lowest economic impact, equal to
$456 billion. Central America and the Caribbean's increase was driven by the deterioration in its economic impact of homicide, which increased by 18.5 per cent from 2018.

The composition of violence varies substantially by region, as shown in Figure 3.6. The greatest variation between regions is the relative impact of military expenditure. This represents 57 per  cent of the economic impact for the MENA region and only eight per cent in the Central America and Caribbean region, a  difference of 49 percentage points.
The next largest variation is in the violent crime, homicide and

suicide category, which varied from 40 per cent of the regional composition in Central America and the Caribbean to four per cent in the MENA region.
Internal security expenditure also varies significantly by region. Europe and Asia-Pacific have the highest percentage, at 48 and 45 per cent respectively. At 28 per cent, South America has the lowest proportion of all regions derived from internal security.

SPENDING ON MILITARY AND INTERNAL SECURITY
The per person military expenditure and internal security are highest in MENA and North America, while Central America and the Caribbean, South Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa spend the least as shown in Figure 3.7. On average, countries in sub-Saharan Africa spend 15 times less on violence containment than MENA and North America. It should be noted that higher expenditure, especially for internal security, would be expected in higher- income countries given the higher wages and better-equipped security and judicial systems.

Table 3.5 highlights the ten countries with the highest military expenditure for 2019 as a total, per capita, and as a percentage of GDP. The United States spends the most of any country annually on its military, however, from a per person perspective, the United States is only the third-largest spender, spending $1,986 per person, the equivalent of two per cent of its GDP. The countries


with the highest per person spending are the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia which both spend over $2,000 per citizen on their militaries, the most of any country.

There is considerable variation in military expenditure by government type. Figure 3.8 displays the trend in the average military expenditure as a percentage of GDP by government types. Since 2000, fully democratic countries spend the least on military as a percentage of GDP, equivalent to 1.4 per cent of GDP. Countries under authoritarian regimes on average spend the most on their military, averaging 3.7 per cent of GDP.

Since 2000, the average military expenditure as a percentage of GDP has fallen across all four government types. Both authoritarian regimes and flawed democracies have reduced their average expenditure by 0.5 percentage points since 2000. This is followed by full democracies at 0.3 percentage points and hybrid regimes by 0.2 percentage points.

Methodology at a glance


The global economic impact of violence is defined as the expenditure and economic effects related to "containing, preventing and dealing with the consequences of violence." The estimate includes the direct and indirect costs of violence, as well as an economic multiplier. The multiplier effect calculates the additional economic activity that would have accrued if the direct costs of violence had been avoided.


Expenditure on containing violence is economically efficient when it prevents violence for the least amount of spending. However, spending beyond an optimal level has the potential to constrain a nation's economic growth. Therefore, achieving the right levels of spending on public services such as the military, judicial and security is important for the most productive use of capital.

This study includes two types of costs: direct and indirect. Examples of direct costs include medical costs for victims of violent crime, capital destruction from violence and costs associated with security and judicial systems. Indirect costs include lost wages or productivity due to physical and emotional trauma. There is also a measure of the impact of fear on the economy, as people who fear that they may become a victim of violent crime alter their behaviour.1

An important aspect of IEP's estimation is the international comparability of the country estimates, thereby allowing cost/ benefit analysis of country interventions. The methodology uses constant purchasing power parity international dollars which allows for the costs of various countries to be compared with one another.

IEP estimates the economic impact of violence by comprehensively aggregating the costs related to violence, armed conflict and spending on military and internal security services. The GPI is the initial point of reference for developing the estimates.

The 2019 version of the economic impact of violence includes 18 variables in three groups.

The analysis presents conservative estimates of the global economic impact of violence. The estimation only includes variables of violence for which reliable data could be obtained. The following are examples of some of the items not counted in the economic impact of violence:

 the cost of crime to business
 judicial system expenditure
 domestic violence
 household out-of-pocket spending on safety and security
 spillover effects from conflict and violence.

The total economic impact of violence includes the following components:

1. Direct costs are the cost of violence to the victim, the perpetrator, and the government. These include direct expenditures, such as the cost of policing, military and medical expenses.
2. Indirect costs accrue after the violent event and include indirect economic losses, physical and psychological trauma to the victim and lost productivity.
3. The multiplier effect represents the flow-on effects of direct costs, such as the additional economic benefits that would come from investment in business development or education, instead of the less productive costs of containing or dealing with violence. Box 3.1 provides a detailed explanation of the peace multiplier used.

The term economic impact of violence covers the combined effect of direct and indirect costs and the multiplier effect, while the economic cost of violence represents the direct and indirect cost of violence. When a country avoids the economic impact of violence, it realises a peace dividend.




BOX 3.1
The multiplier effect


The multiplier effect is a commonly used economic concept, describing the extent to which additional expenditure improves the wider economy. Injections of new income into the economy lead to more spending which, in turn, creates employment, further income and additional spending. This mutually reinforcing economic cycle is known as the "multiplier effect" and is
the reason that a dollar of expenditure can create more than a dollar of economic activity.

spent elsewhere. The economy also benefits by preserving the lifetime income of the victim. The economic benefits from greater peace can therefore be significant. This was also noted by Brauer and Tepper-Marlin (2009), who argued that violence or the fear of violence may result in some economic activities not occurring at all. More
generally, there is strong evidence to suggest that violence and the fear of violence can fundamentally alter the incentives for


Although the exact magnitude of this effect is difficult to measure, it is likely to be particularly high in the case of expenditure related to containing violence. For instance, if a community were to become more peaceful, individuals would spend less time and resources protecting themselves against violence. This decrease in violence has substantial flow-on

of economic activity.

establishing and running businesses. Consequently, with greater levels of violence it is likely that we might expect lower levels of employment and economic productivity over the long-term, as the incentives faced discourage new employment creation and longer-term investment.

This study assumes that the multiplier is one,

effects for the wider economy, as money is diverted towards more productive areas such as health, business investment, education and infrastructure.

When a homicide is avoided, the direct costs, such as money spent on medical treatments or funerals, could be

signifying that for every dollar saved on violence containment, there will be an additional dollar of economic activity. This is a relatively conservative multiplier and broadly in line with academic studies.















POSITIVE PEACE
KEY FINDINGS



j The COVID-19 pandemic will cause substantial changes in how society operates and business is conducted in most countries.
j Positive Peace offers a framework for interpreting and describing the COVID-19 crisis.
j OCED countries with greater development in the Well-Functioning Government and High Levels of Human Capital Pillars have been able to test a higher proportion of their population for the COVID-19 virus.
j The crisis and the social isolation response are expected to send a large number of countries into recession in 2020. The travel and tourism industries are likely to incur severe contractions.

j Other industries affected are hospitality, retail trade, mineral resources, education, recreation, energy and shipping.
j Countries with strong Positive Peace have higher resilience to absorb, adapt and recover from shocks, such as COVID-19 and the ensuing recession.
j Nations that are more likely to recover relatively quickly from the crisis are those which combine low levels of public debt with strong performance in the Well- Functioning Government Pillar.

Overview


Humanity is currently facing one of the most serious crises in recent history. The tragic loss of life and abrupt economic disruption engendered by the COVID-19 pandemic will cause lasting changes in how society operates and business is conducted. Responsiveness and adaptability will determine which countries perform best through this period.


Positive Peace offers a framework for interpreting this pandemic and assessing the interconnectedness between events, responses, perceptions and beliefs. Positive Peace can not only help us understand what is happening now, but can also shine a light on how to best prepare society for future shocks.
The impact of COVID-19 will only be fully known many years from now. However, anecdotal evidence combined with some leading indicators and early forecasts suggest that the pandemic has caused a humanitarian and economic crisis not seen since the mid twentieth century. No other pandemic has created the same level of social disruption globally. No other economic crisis since the Great Depression has been more acute.

Positive Peace is a comprehensive and logical frame of reference to assess this crisis. It helps authorities and stakeholders identify weaknesses and bottlenecks relating to the pandemic and the post-pandemic recovery plans. The dynamic relationships between the Pillars of Positive Peace offers insights into how best to revive economies and prepare for other future shocks.
This section also discusses how countries with high levels of Positive Peace were better prepared to respond to the crisis. The follow on effects from the pandemic will have a significant impact on global peace. Countries that are higher in Positive Peace will be better prepared to manage these effects.





What is Positive Peace?



Positive Peace is defined as the attitudes, institutions and structures that create and sustain peaceful societies. The same factors also lead to many other desirable socio- economic outcomes. Higher levels of Positive Peace are statistically linked to greater income growth, better environmental outcomes, higher levels of wellbeing, better developmental outcomes and stronger resilience.
IEP has empirically derived the Positive Peace Index (PPI) through the analysis of almost 25,000 economic and social progress indicators to determine which ones have statistically significant relationships with peace as measured by the Global Peace Index (GPI).

FIGURE 4.1
What is Positive Peace?
Positive Peace is a complementary concept to negative peace.





THE PILLARS OF POSITIVE PEACE


Positive Peace is predicated on eight key factors, or Pillars, that describe the workings of the socio-economic system:


WELL-FUNCTIONING GOVERNMENT
A well-functioning government delivers high-quality public and civil services, engenders trust and participation, demonstrates political stability and upholds the rule of law.
SOUND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
The strength of economic conditions as well as the formal institutions that support the operation of the private sector. Business competitiveness and economic productivity are both associated with the most peaceful countries.
ACCEPTANCE OF THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS
Peaceful countries often have formal laws that guarantee basic human rights and freedoms, and the informal social and cultural norms that relate to behaviours of citizens.
GOOD RELATIONS WITH NEIGHBORS
Peaceful relations with other countries are as important as good relations between groups within a country.
Countries with positive external relations are more peaceful and tend to be more politically stable, have better functioning governments, are regionally integrated and have lower levels of organised internal conflict.

FREE FLOW OF INFORMATION
Free and independent media disseminates information in a way that leads to greater knowledge and helps individuals, businesses and civil society make better decisions. This leads to better outcomes and more rational responses in times of crisis.
HIGH LEVELS OF HUMAN CAPITAL
A skilled human capital base reflects the extent to which societies educate citizens and promote the development of knowledge, thereby improving economic productivity, care for the young, political participation and social capital.
LOW LEVELS OF CORRUPTION
In societies with high levels of corruption, resources are inefficiently allocated, often leading to a lack of funding for essential services and civil unrest. Low corruption can enhance confidence and trust in institutions.
EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES
Peaceful countries tend to ensure equity in access to resources such as education, health, and to a lesser extent, equity in income distribution.

FIGURE 4.2
The Pillars of Positive Peace
All eight Pillars are highly interconnected and interact in complex ways.






















The Pillars of Positive Peace interact systemically to support a society's attitudes, institutions and structures that underpin development and peacebuilding. High levels of Positive Peace occur where attitudes make violence less tolerated, institutions are resilient and more responsive to society's needs and structures create the environment for the nonviolent  resolution  of grievances.


The Pillars also offer a practical framework for the implementation of small-scale Positive Peace projects. In cooperation with its global partners, IEP implements and supports a number of projects in local communities around the world using the Pillars of Positive Peace as the main framework to plan action and design measurement.

Positive Peace and the COVID-19 Pandemic




The COVID-19 pandemic is a 'once in a hundred years' event and its full socio-economic impact may not be known for many months or even years.1 Positive Peace is a useful framework to start this analysis, as it helps interpret and describe the systemic nature of nation states.

While comprehensive data covering the period of the crisis is still being collected and processed, the Pillars of Peace offer an initial qualitative assessment of how well-prepared societies are to deal

with the impact of COVID-19. This includes potential risks to global peacefulness and how Positive Peace can help countries recover from the shock.

The crisis is still in development, but many of the positive  attributes of Positive Peace are important to facilitating countries' responses to COVID-19. Table 4.1 shows a generalisation of how the Pillars of Peace have been affected and responded to COVID-19.

COVID-19 IN CONTEXT
The number of deaths caused by COVID-19 rose sharply early in 2020 and the pandemic surpassed H1N1/09 (swine flu) as the most lethal outbreak of the 21st century, as shown in Table 4.2.


Although COVID-19 it is not the first global pandemic of the 21st century, it is unusual given its high speed of propagation and deadliness. Epidemics and pandemics tend to more heavily affect countries with low to medium socio-economic development.
However, COVID-19 is similar to HIV/AIDS, SARS and H1N1/09 in that it is also seriously affecting developed countries.

Notes: *Data as at mid May 2020.


Among OECD countries, there is some relationship between the fatality rates of COVID-19 and the age profile of the populations as seen in Figure 4.3. Countries with greater proportions of older citizens tend to record higher fatality rates. This corroborates epidemiological findings that the elderly are more vulnerable to this particular infection.6,7 Outside the OECD, other factors may influence COVID-19 lethality, such as levels of poverty, access to health care, the quality of the health system and the ability of authorities to implement social distancing. Additional  traits  of this pandemic are that it affects men more pronouncedly than women and the rate of infection appears to be higher in colder climates (around +4C and humidity between 20 per cent and 80 per cent).8,9,10,11

RESPONDING TO A PANDEMIC
The Epidemiological Curve is a visual representation of the total number of cases during an epidemic over time, as per Figure 4.4. The greater the contagion power of an epidemic, the more cases will be contracted in its onset and the steeper will be the initial upswing in the curve. The red line represents the capacity of the health system to treat patients who contract the disease.

If no attempt is made to tackle the pandemic, the speed at which total cases increase will mean that there will quickly be more patients than the health system can handle, leading to an increase in the number of patients who don't receive treatment, and a subsequent increase in the death rate.

The impact of Positive Peace on a pandemic response
Positive Peace can both help 'flatten the curve' and increase health system capacity over time.













TIME

Positive Peace helps to flatten the epidemiological curve as Positive Peace is a measure of a society's ability to adapt to changing circumstances. Two Pillars, Well-Functioning Government and High Levels of Human Capital serve as an example, although all eight Pillars are important.

Firstly, The Well-Functioning Government Pillar allows authorities to act quickly to enforce border lockdowns, quarantine regimes, isolation schemes, banning certain gatherings and other measures to curtail the rate of infections. This has the effect of 'flattening' the epidemiological curve. It is also associated with having a more robust health system.

Secondly, a combination of Well-Functioning Government and High Levels of Human Capital means that authorities can increase the testing and treatment capacity by diverting public and private resources to the treatment of the pandemic.12 This has the effect of increasing health-system capacity. The combined effect of both interventions is a reduction in the severity of the pandemic.

The other Pillars are also important as they underpin trust in authorities and promote social cohesion. For example, Equitable Distribution of Resources and Acceptance of the Rights of Others

guarantee that all citizens regardless of social status or ethnicity have access to health services. Sound Business Environment and Low Levels of Corruption make sure that the economy has enough resources to support the health system and that isolation regimes are equitable and adhered to. In general, all Pillars support the capacity of the socio-economic system to mitigate the impact of a shock such as this pandemic.

Highlighting the importance of Positive Peace, its Well- Functioning Government and High Levels of Human Capital Pillars are associated with more robust responses to the pandemic. OECD countries with greater development in these Pillars have been able to test a higher proportion of their population for the COVID-19 virus, as shown in Figure 4.5.

However, high levels of Positive Peace alone will not provide every solution for reducing the severity of a pandemic. For example, one

dilemma epidemiologists face is that by imposing strict quarantine and lock-down regimes, they slow down the upswing in cases but also reduce the rate at which the population develops immunity through contact with the virus, thus slowing or preventing herd immunity. This means that under intense social isolation, the epidemiological curve would have a low peak but a long right-side tail, or even secondary outbreaks.

On the other hand, by relaxing isolation regimes and allowing greater exposure to the virus, herd immunity may be achieved more quickly. In this situation, the epidemiological curve is high but narrow. However, this strategy does not take into account the human consequences of high death rates and the fear and emotional trauma emanating from these actions.

THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON POSITIVE PEACE


While it is too soon to know the full extent of the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the world, some developments had an almost immediate impact on countries' levels of Positive Peace. The high number of fatalities is a tragedy in itself, but the measures taken to confront and contain the pandemic are also having an extremely severe economic impact.

With lockdown schemes widely adopted, there have been marked declines in urban movement by March 2020, compared with the end-2019 reference level, as shown in Figure 4.6. If urban movement can be taken as a proxy for commercial activity, it is clear that business activity and economic output will contract substantially in the first half of 2020 and well beyond.




OCED countries with greater development in the Well-Functioning Government and High Levels of Human Capital Pillars have been able to test a higher proportion of their population for the COVID-19 virus.

The Good Relations With Neighbours Pillar has also been affected by the crisis. Figure 4.7 shows that there has been a widespread decline in air travel in 2020, with the global scheduled capacity - the number of available seats on scheduled flights - falling by 60 per cent over the year to April. This figure likely underestimates the true contraction in air travel because many planes are taking off with large numbers of empty seats. In China, scheduled

capacity had fallen by almost 70 per cent by mid-February, but it has since started to recover. The contraction in Italy and Spain came around one month later but stopped virtually all air travel in those countries. It is unlikely that the travel and tourism industry will recover until a vaccine is found for COVID-19 and the looming recession has passed.

Other developments clearly indicate further adverse impacts on the indicators of Positive Peace:

International Tourism
The level of international tourism has collapsed in the first half of 2020. The cessation of tourism will have a negative impact on the global economy in 2020. The OECD estimates that tourism makes up 4.4 per cent of member countries' GDP and 21.5 per cent of their service exports, as shown in Table 4.3.

Hypothetically, if tourism were to stop completely for four months in 2020, this disruption would detract 1.5 percentage points from annual GDP growth and 7.2 percentage points from service export growth. Adding these two negative contributions (and accounting for service exports comprising 6.8 per cent of OECD GDP), the shutting down of tourism activity would detract two percentage points from annual GDP growth in the OECD. This means that if OECD GDP were to grow in 2020 by 2.3 per cent, as it did in 2018, the collapse of tourism alone could cut this number down to 0.3 per cent. This suggests that the disruption of the tourism industry alone could wipe out all the potential for economic growth in the OECD for 2020. This estimation does not take into account the decline in overall employment due to tourism workers losing their jobs, which could further drain consumption.

Hostility to foreigners/private property
The barring of foreign entry as a result of COVID-19 was an act of epidemiological control, rather than social hostility. However, these acts in addition to populations' fear of the pandemic have triggered spikes in cases of xenophobia and racial profiling.15,16

The extent of regional integration
Regional trade will be reduced as a consequence of lower consumption and the interruption of international travel. The Dry Baltic Index - which gauges the cost of and demand for international maritime shipping of dry goods - has fallen by almost 80 per cent from its late 2019 peak to March 2020.
Participation in regional trade alliances may not decline substantially, as countries hope to resume activity post pandemic.

GDP per capita
Global GDP growth for 2020 has been revised down from 2.9 per cent to negative three per cent, with the IMF forecasting that only two countries will have positive GDP growth for 2020. JP Morgan forecast that US GDP could decline by two per cent in the March quarter 2020 and three per cent in the June quarter. Forecast declines for the Eurozone are 1.3 per cent and 3.3 per cent in the same periods.17 These forecasts almost certainly imply negative annual GDP growth in the US and Europe for 2020 and are probably conservative. China is one of the two countries expected to grow, but with substantially reduced growth rates.

Business environment
This is likely to be one of the indicators most adversely impacted by COVID-19. However, the impact of the pandemic will not be homogeneous across all business sectors. The sectors that are most likely to be negatively affected by the disruptions are aviation, banking and finance, hospitality, recreation, tourism, travel, retail, energy, mineral resources, shipping and education. Business  sectors that may avoid serious disruptions are telecommunications, information technology and food production.18 Some professional services - such as marketing, accounting, legal and human resources may also navigate the crisis relatively well if they concentrate on client profiles not severely disrupted by the pandemic. Once the pandemics abate, governments will attempt to kick-start economic activity possibly with large, 'shovel-ready' infrastructure projects which could buoy the construction and industrial machinery sectors.

Share of youth not in employment, education or training (NEET)
The Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis forecast that the US unemployment rate could rise to 32 per cent as a consequence of COVID-19.19 This compares with around four per cent in 2019.
Unemployment is also expected to rise sharply in other countries affected by the pandemic. Traditionally, youth unemployment rates are much higher than for the population average. In addition,   youth tend to be over-represented in areas such as hospitality and retail trade - areas severely impacted by the economic disruption.

Poverty headcount ratio at $5.50 a day
The global economic downturn and the disruption of global trade can increase poverty rates in developed and emerging economies. In developed countries that had a relatively benign fiscal position before the crisis, governments will borrow in order to increase welfare payments and support to businesses. This will mitigate some of the impact of the pandemic on poverty rates. However, in countries that were already heavily indebted prior to the   pandemic, the ability to support economic activity will be less. In addition, developing countries will also be more limited in their ability to apply fiscal largesse because their tax revenue is already constrained and their tax base often too narrow. The result may be a sharp increase in food insecurity and the proportion of the   global population living below the poverty line.

Freedom of the Press
There have been cases of press freedoms being suppressed as a result of administrative measures to combat the COVID-19 outbreak in some countries.20,21,22,23,24 In addition, many governments have acted with considerable speed in implementing contagion reduction measures. While this was welcome during the rapid onset of the crisis, it reduced the transparency around administrative decision making.

Countries with robust press freedoms and higher trust in the media are better able to broadcast more accurate information on the pandemic and the actions necessary to face it, as well as be believed by the general population.

POSITIVE PEACE AS A BLUEPRINT FOR THE POST-PANDEMIC RECOVERY
Countries that are most likely to recover quickly from the pandemic are those with strong performances in Well-Functioning Government, Sound Business Environment, High Levels of Human Capital and Good Relations with Neighbours before the crisis.
These were the Pillars most directly affected by COVID-19 and countries that perform well in these areas will find it easier to return to pre-crisis states of systemic development. However, sustainable, long-term socio-economic improvement can only be achieved with balanced growth in all Pillars. This is a principle to which nations can turn their attention after the worst of the crisis has been overcome.

Many countries implemented stimulus packages to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on their economies and set the stage for a post-pandemic recovery. Some of these packages have been large and require substantial funding through the issuance of  government debt. This can be problematic, especially if the current stock of liabilities is largely short to medium term and in foreign currency. Countries that had relatively small amounts of debt outstanding before the crisis will be better placed to fund stimulus and recovery programs without much deterioration to credit   ratings and the cost of debt.

Among OECD nations, those that had strong scores on Well- Functioning Government, combined with low debt before the pandemic will be well placed to implement robust recovery programs, which can be seen in Figure 4.8. Outside the OECD, effective governments and low debt will also be important, with many lower-income countries requiring direct external assistance and debt forgiveness.

The first wave of the pandemic has led to an increased focus on the balance between globalisation and economic sovereignty.
Countries with lower dependency on international trade - that is, higher economic sovereignty - may be less affected by global disruptions such as COVID-19. In light of this, governments have started to include economic sovereignty considerations in
post-pandemic recovery plans. For example, Japan launched a program to help Japanese companies shift some manufacturing activity from foreign countries back into the domestic fold.25 India is adopting similar measures. In the US, the federal government and companies are discussing how to bring some manufacturing back inside national borders.26

One way to measure economic sovereignty is by comparing a country's total imports and exports as a proportion of GDP. Countries with a lower ratio of trade to GDP tend to be more self-reliant. In addition, a country's import content of exports shows how much a nation's ability to export would be compromised if it could not secure goods and services from abroad.

Countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain operate with relatively high economic sovereignty, as seen in Figure 4.9, but have high government debt and lower development in Well-Functioning Government. This suggests that their key economic challenges will be mostly domestic, as they seek to fund and coordinate a revival in internal activity. On the other hand, Ireland, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Belgium and others hold less debt and have more effective administrations. However, their economic recovery will depend on the speed with which regional and global trade resumes.

Nations that had high unemployment rates prior to the pandemic will be hit more severely by COVID-19. This is because the pandemic will affect their economies at a time when they are already fragile. The OECD has a widespread range of unemployment rates, as illustrated in Figure 4.10. Of particular concern is the rate of long-term unemployment - those unemployed for 27 weeks or more as a proportion of the labour force. Countries with high long-term unemployment may have excessively rigid labour markets or low levels of worker education and re-skilling. In contrast, countries with low levels of long- and short-term unemployment may find it easier to absorb the impact of the pandemic and re-allocate workers to critical sectors in its aftermath.

A robust and agile business sector - including research and development activity - will be critical for the recovery efforts. A well-developed Sound Business Environment and High Levels of Human Capital will allow businesses to adapt to new post- pandemic consumer demands, rapid technological disruption, a labour market in turmoil and shifting governmental priorities. Nations with good performance in these two Pillars are likely to experience more robust recoveries post pandemic, as seen in Figure 4.11

Some OECD countries will do well in most of the abovementioned criteria. They have lower debt, effective governments, high economic sovereignty, agile business sectors and robust investment in technological and scientific research. Others will have weaknesses in specific areas that should be addressed to facilitate the post pandemic recovery efforts.

FAMINES AND FOOD SECURITY
Outside the OECD, the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) warned that some vulnerable societies are facing a 'crisis within a crisis,' as the threat of famine is added to the risk of infection. Around 113 million people around the world were unable to feed themselves properly even before the pandemic disrupted the global economy in 2020.27 FAO is particularly concerned with food deprivation in the Sahel region, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, Afghanistan, Haiti, Syria and Myanmar. In addition to the economic downturn damaging livelihoods, the pandemic also


increases the probability of famine through the lockdowns and travel bans preventing aid from reaching vulnerable communities.

The Food Security Index ranks countries according to the availability, affordability and quality of food accessible to the population. It shows that many countries in Africa and Latin America were already facing food insecurity before COVID-19, as illustrated in Table 4.4. The pandemic is expected to worsen the situation, especially if Africa and Latin America start recording larger proportions of infected persons towards mid-2020 and implement lockdowns in order to halt the spread of the virus.

Trends in Positive Peace



The potential impact of Positive Peace on the response to the COVID-19 pandemic can be better understood by looking at the trends in Positive Peace over the last decade. Positive Peace is defined as the attitudes, institutions and structures that create   and sustain peaceful societies. Each of the 24 indicators across the eight Pillars of the Positive Peace Index can be categorized using that three-part typology:

 Attitudes if they measure social views, tensions or perceptions;
 Institutions if they directly measure institutional operations; and
 Structures if they are embedded in the framework of society, such as poverty and equality, or are the result of aggregate activity, such as GDP.

Using this classification process, Figure 4.12 shows that the improvement in the PPI since 2009 is largely driven by structural improvements, with the Structures indicator improving by seven per cent on average since 2009. While Structures has been improving each year and has improved by seven per cent since 2009, Attitudes has deteriorated each year to be 3.9 per cent worse than a decade ago.

GDP per capita, gender equality and poverty have generally improved over time. Globally, institutional functioning has remained largely constant over the same period, except for some fluctuations during the international financial crises. However, the attitudinal indicators have been deteriorating over the period. The indicators to show the biggest deteriorations are quality of information, factionalized elites and hostility to foreigners.

CHANGES IN THE POSITIVE PEACE PILLARS
Figure 4.13 shows the percentage change from 2009 to 2018 for all eight Pillars of Positive Peace. These scores reflect gradual changes within complex social systems and typically do not fluctuate drastically year-to-year. As such, since 2009, the average Pillar score has changed by just 2.6 per cent, and no Pillar score has changed by more than eight per cent. The slow-moving nature of Positive Peace calls for long-term planning and sustained investment in improving the Pillars.

The individual indicators change more quickly, as highlighted in Figure 4.14. Because Positive Peace works as a system where each factor affects the others, it is important to be aware of which indicators tend to change quickly or slowly. For example, the average score for access to internet has improved by 27 per cent since 2009, indicating a rapid increase in access to information. At the other end of the spectrum, the use of disinformation by governments - quality of information - has deteriorated with the access to technology and as such the PPI score for this indicator has shown a deterioration of 10.4 per cent over the period.

The factionalized elites indicator with is a measure in the Low Levels of Corruption Pillar, measures "the fragmentation of state institutions along ethnic, class, clan, racial or religious lines,"28 it deteriorated by 7.8 per cent.

The only region in the world to deteriorate in the ten years to 2018 was North America which fell by 4.9 per cent. This region consists of only two countries Canada and the US. All the other eight regions improved. The deterioration in North America was mainly driven by the US, although Canada did also deteriorate.

Introduction
IEP has developed an Ecological Threat Register (ETR), which combines a set of ecological risks with Positive Peace and economic coping capacity, to better understand where future potential risks and fragilities may occur. Trends will be estimated through to 2050. This body of work will be a first release in a series which will be further developed and enhanced in the coming years.


The ETR aims to show both exposure to risk and the ability of nations to deal with these ecological risks. The measures and metrics developed here provide new tools for assessing peace- ecological-climate risks and associated opportunities for intervention.
The relationship between ecological risks, such as food insecurity and water scarcity, and

decades, while the cost has far exceeded their natural inflationary impact, rising from US$50 billion in the 1980s to US$200 billion per year in the last decade. Hydrological events that result in 'sharp and harmful changes either in the quality of the earth's
water, or its distribution', either in aquifers, rivers, cyclones or floods, have seen the largest increase since 1980.

peacefulness is complex. It does not always  take the same form, but the research is clear  that changes in the  natural  environment impose stresses on human societies. Emerging ecological threats will serve as a risk multiplier for ongoing political and socioeconomic tensions. The ability for nations  to  mitigate and adapt to new ecological threats will be crucial in ensuring the survival of existing political institutions and to avoid future social unrest and violence. The key to future success will be the levels of resilience that nations have
   
Hydrological events that result in 'sharp and harmful changes either in the quality of the earth's water, or its distribution', either in aquifers, rivers, cyclones or floods, have seen the largest increase
since 1980.



There is a strong relationship between extreme weather events and displacement. For instance, in Ethiopia, droughts in the mid-1970s and 1980s and subsequent famines led to waves of voluntary and government- forced displacement from drought-stressed areas. In this case, both climatic and political factors impacted displacement and international migration. The effects of such mass population displacement were not limited to Ethiopia, but affected other countries in the region, causing increases in

developed. Countries with low or declining peacefulness will be
the ones most at risk.

The increase in the number of ecological threats can already be seen. Figure 5.1 illustrates the total number of natural disasters from 1980 to 2019. This number has tripled in the last four

instability, violence and insecurity in neighbouring countries.

Global data on population displacement shows that nearly 19 million people were displaced by natural disasters in 2017. The displacement due to natural disasters is substantially larger than that due to conflict. Figure 5.2 shows new and cumulative

displacement for both natural disasters and violent conflict. It is estimated that by 2050 climate change will create up to 86   million additional migrants in sub-Saharan Africa, 40 million in South Asia and 17 million in Latin America as agricultural conditions and water availability deteriorate across these regions. Empirical evidence suggests that people living in less developed countries without the ability to mitigate these problems are those most likely to migrate and that this migration may cause   increased societal strife in destination countries and regions.
In the absence of other adaptation mechanisms, migration is the most probable and effective strategy for individuals to adopt.
Positive Peace can be used as the basis for empirically measuring a country's resilience to shocks, including ecological threats. It

also provides a framework to assess the capability of nation states to respond and adapt to climate change. Positive Peace is defined as the attitudes, institutions  and  structures  that  create  and sustain peaceful societies. Institutions at a local, regional and global level can mitigate climate-related conflict by creating resilience related programs and managing  climate  related disputes. Countries with high levels of Positive Peace will be  better able to mitigate, absorb, and respond  to  emerging ecological threats. Such countries are strong in all eight of the Pillars of Positive Peace, which allows them to mobilise and if necessary, adapt to new challenges.

THE ECOLOGICAL THREAT REGISTER
IEP has developed an Ecological Threat Register (ETR), which combines a confluence of ecological risks with Positive Peace and economic coping capacity to illustrate the intersection between ecological risk and societal risk, which can impact on economic performance and peace. The ETR aims to show both exposure to risk and also the ability of nations to deal with ecological risks. Box 5.1 provides a brief methodology of the ETR.


The ETR correlates positively with Positive Peace. This indicates that countries with higher risk have not developed the coping capacities to address these risks. These same countries generally also have lower levels of peace. Ecological risks included in the measure are water stress, food insecurity, droughts, floods, sea level rise and population growth. Figure 5.3 shows the correlation between the ecological threat register and Positive Peace.






Based on the relationship between ecological risks and Positive Peace, countries can be divided into three distinct groups: low peace and high exposure to risks, medium peace with high exposure to risks, and high peace with low exposure to risks.

The first group of countries, which have low peace and high exposure, include countries like Afghanistan, Syria, Sudan, Yemen and Mali, all of which suffer from ongoing armed conflicts.
Examples of the second group - medium peace and high exposure
- include India, Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya and Burkina Faso. The high peace and low risk exposure group include countries such as Iceland, Uruguay, New Zealand, Panama and Sweden.

This classification aims to identify countries where a significant deficit in peacefulness and societal resistance coincides with high

level of climate change induced ecological threats. It assesses key patterns and country-specific risks to assess how the dynamics of climate change related ecological risks may combine to foster instability, strain state capacity and undermine human security. It needs to be noted that regardless of how resilient or how high Positive Peace may be, if the shock is of sufficient strength, then the societal system will collapse.

The Pillars of Positive Peace highlight the social, institutional and economic capacity of a society. When low levels of Positive Peace compound with ecological risks, this indicates a greater level of vulnerability to governance failures.

The Types of Ecological Threat

FOOD SECURITY


Trends in food security started to deteriorate in 2017 after decades of improvement. Globally, 873 million people experienced hunger and food insecurity in 2017. This number increases to two billion people when moderate levels of food insecurity are factored in.

Food security requires availability, access and utilisation of sufficient food to meet dietary needs for a productive and healthy life. Food security is affected by numerous factors, such as climate change, depletion of water tables, economic development, technology, social and political stability and the overall resilience of a society in the face of shocks. Many countries might not be able to ensure food security due to inappropriate agricultural

technologies or practice, lack of natural resources or productive land, or emergency situations like natural disasters.

Food security is strongly correlated with Positive Peace, highlighting that less peaceful countries experience a greater degree of hunger and undernourishment. Lack of peacefulness and food security creates a vicious cycle, in which political instability and social unrest leads to negative impacts on food security, which in turn fuels higher levels of political instability. The Pillars of Peace provide a framework for analysis of causes and dimensions of food security.

For  instance, countries that have a Sound Business Environment  that include indicators of strong economic stability and  performance, will better address food supply shocks. The Equitable Distribution of Resources Pillar provides guidance on the ability of a society to address inequality in access to food. Figure 5.4 shows the correlation between food security and Positive Peace.

Figure 5.5 highlights the number of people experiencing severe hunger and food insecurity by level of peace. Over 750 million people in the world's 80 least peaceful countries experience food insecurity, compared to slightly over 100 million in the high peace countries. Recent projections of food security by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisations (FAO) show that almost all scenarios highlight an increase in the number of people that will face hunger and undernourishment in the coming decades to 2050.

The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated economic consequences will accelerate adverse impacts on food security. This will be seen in broken supply chains, reduction and reallocation of aid and disruption in domestic agricultural productions. In addition, when economic activity halts due to lockdown and social distancing measures, poorer households, who are dependent on their daily wages, will lose the income to purchase food. For many people, the wage they earn that day is used to feed them and their families that night. Panic buying also feeds into price increases through heightening demand.

In response to COVID-19, some food exporting countries have adopted protectionist policies to secure their own food supply. This may create shortages in countries that strongly depend on imports. For instance, Kazakhstan and Vietnam have temporarily suspended wheat flour and rice exports, of which both are respectively among the largest exporters globally.2

This will be particularly concerning in countries where a large proportion of the population already experience hunger and undernourishment. Unlike the Ebola outbreak of 2016, multilateral

A recent analysis by Care International shows that the risk of socioeconomic vulnerabilities will be nine times higher and the risk of severe food insecurity will be four times higher among countries who are already fragile compared to those with low initial risk.3 Care International identified Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Afghanistan, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Uganda, the Central African Republic, Chad, Niger and Haiti as having very high risk of food shortages from the COVID-19 pandemic. These 15 countries are among the least peaceful on the Global Peace Index and have low levels of Positive Peace.

WATER SECURITY
A significant impact of climate change on the global food system is through increased water scarcity. Water use or demand has increased by one per cent per year for the last four decades since 1980.4 This increasing demand is driven by population growth, increased economic activity and changing consumption patterns. The water demand has increased across all types of uses including domestic, industrial and agriculture.

World Resource Institute projections show that water stress will increase across some regions and countries more than others over the coming decades to 2040.

In addition, climate change is poised to drastically change water supplies by changing precipitation patterns leading to droughts  and floods. Underground water tables have also shown signs of depletion, particularly in semi-arid and arid environments, including in regions in China, India and the US, but also in humid environments like Brazil and Bangladesh.5 Projections of the water tables in some regions are indicating further depletion of the underground water resource over the coming decades. In addition, new dams are also restricting the water flows in areas that have traditionally been major food producers. The damming of the Mekong River in China has led to a trickle of water during droughts and the end of the dry season in countries further downstream.

The United Nations World Water Development Report 2019 highlights that more than two billion people live in countries




FIGURE 5.6
Areas of exposure to high and extremely high water scarcity risks by level of peacefulness
Water related risks are the highest in the least peaceful countries.


which already experience high water stress, and about four billion people experience severe water scarcity during at least one month of the year. The natural increase for water demand, population increases and the effects of climate change will accelerate the stress on water supplies in the coming decades.

Estimates of areas exposed to high or very high levels of water scarcity show that the least peaceful countries have more areas affected, as shown in Figure 5.6.

Agriculture consumes the largest share of the water supply in most countries, followed by industrial and then domestic consumption.

The MENA region is currently the most water-scarce region and at highest risk of increased stress. MENA has the highest percentage of medium to extremely high-risk catchments, at 92 per cent of total catchments. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa follow, with 83 and 54 per cent of their catchments ranked between medium and extremely high risk, as identified in Figure 5.7.

In the future, more extreme changes in rainfall patterns are likely for the African continent. Warming of the African continent has increased by 0.5 degrees Celsius or more in the last century, and the mean annual temperature is expected to increase by 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the 21st century. The United Nations Environmental Programme projects that almost all sub-Saharan African countries will be water scarce by 2025.


More than two billion people live in countries experiencing high water stress, and about four billion people experience severe water scarcity for at least one month of the year. Water use has increased by one per cent per year for the last four decades.

Water has caused conflicts and disputes within countries and between nations. With increasing water demand and pressure from climate change, acceleration in economic activity and population growth, competition for water will intensify.
Competition for water resources will test societal resilience within countries, as well as the capacity of the global multilateral system in mediating hostilities and managing the flow on effects, such as mass population displacement.

As shown in Figure 5.8, tensions over scarce water resources resulted in increasing numbers of water related disputes in 32 countries across Europe, MENA and sub-Saharan Africa.

Fortunately, most of these disputes are resolved cooperatively, indicating that changes in climate and resources do not inevitably lead to conflict. Comparing events over time, cooperative events consistently outweighed conflict events for the period measured, from 1997 to 2009, as shown in Figure 5.8. However, from 2007 to

2009 a greater share of events led to conflict, with some of them leading to violence. In 2007, 71 per cent of the total 462 water- related disputes were addressed positively and cooperatively. By 2009, this figure had fallen to 58 per cent.

The Syrian conflict illustrates the impact ecological risks can have on intensifying existing social and political grievances. It also highlights that adverse effects of climate change related ecological risk, such as population displacement, play a critical role in igniting extreme level of mass violence and armed conflict.

From 1999 to 2011, approximately 60 per cent of Syrian land underwent two long-term droughts. About 75 per cent of farmers had total crop failure, and in the northeast, farmers lost 80 per cent of their livestock. This forced a substantial proportion of the population to relocate to urban centres, with an estimated 1.3 to
1.5 million people migrating by 2011. The World Bank estimated in a 2011 survey of Syrian migrants that over 85 per cent of the respondents used migration as an "adaptation strategy."
CLIMATE CHANGE
Climate change has caused warming of the atmosphere and ocean, the amount of snow and ice to diminish and sea levels to rise. The effects of these trends pose a major challenge to peacefulness in the coming decades by increasing resource scarcity and the effects this will have on livelihoods.

The impacts of different climate change hazards on food security and water scarcity have already emerged in many regions and countries. The World Economic Forum believes that by 2050, climate change induced environmental risks will have a greater negative impact than any other economic, geopolitical, societal, or technological changes. Countries that fail to adapt will be facing the biggest risks.

The severity and impacts of environmental risks vary across geographic regions. Some regions face multiple ecological threats. However, other areas might face a single climate related hazard,

which could simply exceed the capabilities of the state and society to mitigate and address its impacts.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fifth assessment report estimates with high confidence that there will be a further 1.5-degree Celsius increase in Earth's surface temperature between 2030 and 2052. Further deterioration in the climate will risk severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts with the following potential effects:

 rising land and sea temperatures in most of the world
 extremely high temperatures in most of the places where people live, with extreme lows at night
 extreme rainfall with flash flooding in some places and droughts in others
 continued sea level rises and costal erosion

As shown in Figure 5.9, temperatures have increased over the past 30 years. The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have confirmed that the global temperatures of the past five years are the hottest on record, reflecting an ongoing trend of warming. Recent estimations place 2018 at approximately one degree Celsius warmer than the
1850-1900 pre-industrial average, with greenhouse gas concentrations such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrogen oxide reaching record highs of 146, 257 and 122 per cent of
pre-industrial levels, respectively. The mean global sea level rose
3.7 millimetres in 2018 when compared to the prior year.

Recent estimates from Climate Central, an independent climate research organisation, projects a rise in sea levels of up to
2.1-meters by 2100, which could potentially permanently drown land that is currently home to 200 million people around the   world. Coastal flooding resulting from sea level rise will impact the lives of 300 million people who live in low-lying coastal areas in China, Bangladesh, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, and Thailand over the next three decades.6

Climate change hazard correlates strongly with Positive Peace, which suggests that countries with lower levels of Positive Peace are exposed to higher hazards from climate change. Figure 5.10 shows the correlation between peacefulness and climate hazard and exposure risk score.

It will be difficult for the least peaceful countries to mitigate the effects of climate change or address its adverse impacts. This also means that the combination of lower resilience and higher risk could tip some of these countries into cycles of instability and violence. This latter effect is particularly important in countries where socio-political drivers of conflict and unrest are present.

The impact of climate change is further highlighted by the number of people exposed to high or very high climate change risks. A larger number of people in the world's least peaceful countries are

facing climate risks. The risks included in the analyses are cyclones, floods, wildfires, rainfall anomalies, chronic aridity, and low-elevation coastal zones susceptible to storm surges and future sea level rise. Figure 5.11 shows the proportion and number of population at high or very high risk of climate change by level of peacefulness.

Sub-Saharan Africa is the most exposed region globally, with 45 per cent of its population exposed to climate hazards, followed by Central America and the Caribbean and South Asia. However, there are large differences between countries, even within the same region. For instance, countries in the Sahel region are facing more climate change hazards than other sub-Saharan African countries. Figure 5.12 shows the proportion of population exposed to high or very high risk of climate hazards by region.

CATASTROPHIC ECOLOGICAL THREATS
The severity of ecological threats varies across geographic regions and time. In some cases, the impacts of the environmental disruption are well beyond a county's capacity to address.

Catastrophic risks are particularly important from the perspective of social stability and resilience. An example is the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. This catastrophic natural disaster caused widespread destruction, leading to social chaos and the breakdown of law and order. Conversely, Japan fared much better after the 2011 tsunami, which led to a nuclear power plant meltdown, resulting in deaths and destruction. However, the incident did not create any social or political instability and the Japanese government was able to address both the destruction from the tsunami and contain the damage from the meltdown of the nuclear power plant. Japan scores highly in Positive Peace.

Defining and understanding the threshold at which a risk could become catastrophic differs across countries and context.
Nevertheless, this research does set a threshold for each of the levels of risk. The thresholds, along with the results, are explained in Table 5.1.

Water stress compares available water to the amount withdrawn for agriculture, domestic and industrial needs. The indicator used in the ETR compares supply to demand and ranks countries on their ability to balance these two. When a country scores three on this indicator in the ETR, it is considered a catastrophic level of water scarcity. Water stress measures the shortfall of water supply to meet the demand in a particular country.7 Once this criterion is applied, 44 of 164 countries are at high risk of water stress. These countries are located in the Middle East and North Africa,
sub-Saharan and Central Asia regions. The five countries with the highest water stress are Qatar, Israel, Lebanon, Iran and Jordan.

Food insecurity is defined as catastrophic if the prevalence of regular hunger and undernourishment is greater than 25 per cent of the population. Sierra Leone, Liberia and Niger were among the most affected with over 80 per cent of the population experiencing severve food insecurity in 2017. More recent estimates from the Global Hunger Index suggest that Central African Republic, Yemen and Chad are the countries currently most at risk of hunger and food insecurity.9


Similarly, populations at risk of rising sea levels are considered to be at catastrophic levels if it affects more than ten per cent of a country's population over the coming decades. Estimates for this criteria puts 19 of the 91 countries for which data was available at the catastrophic level for this risk. This includes many smaller countries such as Suriname as well as cities with large populations such as Alexandria in Egypt, the Hague in the Netherlands and Osaka in Japan.10 Table 5.1 summarises the scale of catastrophic risk across the world.

The strength of a society - its resilience, adaptability and its governance - will be crucial in dealing with ecological threats and climate change. Societies that are strong in all eight Pillars of  Peace are going to be better able to weather the impacts. This has been highlighted by the correlations between the Ecological Threat Register, climate hazard and exposure to risk and Positive Peace in Figures 5.10 and 5.13.

IEP's research finds that a greater number of countries with low levels of Positive Peace suffer from both fiscal and current account deficits. This limits the capacity of these governments in addressing economic and climatic shocks. In addition, the relationship indicates that countries with higher levels of Positive Peace have better price stability, thereby reducing uncertainty and inefficiency in the market, which in turn facilitates more business investment.

The relationship between Positive Peace and strong economic fundamentals shows that less peaceful countries are more likely to suffer from macroeconomic weakness. Less peaceful countries experience more frequent boom and bust cycles leading to higher volatility and lower economic growth rates. On average, economic growth is nearly three times higher in the very high Positive Peace countries compared to the least peaceful. Per capita economic growth is among the leading determinants of food security, employment and reduction in poverty and vulnerabilities. Figure
5.14 shows long-term per capita GDP growth by level of peace.

APPENDICES



The GPI was founded by Steve Killelea, an Australian technology entrepreneur and philanthropist. It is produced by the Institute for Economics and Peace, a global think tank dedicated to developing metrics to analyse peace and to quantify its economic benefits.

The GPI measures a country's level of Negative Peace using three domains of peacefulness. The first domain, Ongoing Domestic and International Conflict, investigates the extent to which countries are involved in internal and external conflicts, as well as their role and duration of involvement in conflicts.

The second domain evaluates the level of harmony or discord within a nation; ten indicators broadly assess what might be described as Societal Safety and Security. The assertion is that low crime rates, minimal terrorist activity and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighbouring countries, a stable political scene and a small proportion of the population being internally displaced or made refugees can be equated with peacefulness.

Seven further indicators are related to a country's Militarisation
-reflecting the link between a country's level of military build-up and access to weapons and its level of peacefulness, both domestically and internationally. Comparable data on military expenditure as a percentage of GDP and the number of armed service officers per head are gauged, as are financial contributions to UN peacekeeping missions.

THE INDICATORS


The GPI comprises 23 indicators of the absence of violence or fear of violence. The indicators were originally selected with the assistance of the expert panel in 2007 and have been reviewed by the expert panel on an annual basis. All scores for each indicator are normalised on a scale of 1-5, whereby qualitative indicators are banded into five groupings and quantitative ones are scored from 1 to 5, to the third decimal point.

METHODOLOGICAL NOTES




WEIGHTING THE INDEX

When the GPI was launched in 2007 the advisory panel of independent experts apportioned scores based on the relative importance of each of the indicators on a scale of 1-5. Two
sub-component weighted indices were then calculated from the GPI group of indicators:

1. A measure of how at peace internally a country is;

2. A measure of how at peace externally a country is (its state of peace beyond its borders).

The overall composite score and index was then formulated by applying a weight of 60 per cent to the measure of internal peace and 40 per cent to external peace. The heavier weight applied to internal peace was agreed upon by the advisory panel, following robust debate. The decision was based on the notion that a greater level of internal peace is likely to lead to, or at least correlate with, lower external conflict. The weights have been reviewed by the advisory panel prior to the compilation of each edition of the GPI.

MEASURING THE ROBUSTNESS OF THE INDEX

g	Robustness is an important concept in composite index analysis. It is a measure of how often rank comparisons from a composite index are still true if the index is calculated using different weightings. For example, if the GPI is recalculated using a large number of different weighting schemes and Country A ranks higher than Country B in 60 per cent of these recalculations, the statement "Country A is more peaceful than Country B" is considered to be 60 per cent robust.
g	IEP finds that the Global Peace Index (GPI) is at the same
level of absolute robustness as the Human Development Index (HDI), a leading measure of development since it was first constructed by the United Nations Development Programme in 1990.
g	Technically, the robustness of the GPI is measured by the fact that 70 per cent of pairwise country comparisons are independent of the weighting scheme chosen. In other words, regardless of the weights attributed to each component of the index, 70 per cent of the time the pairwise comparisons between countries are the same.

The GPI is a composite index of 23 indicators weighted and combined into one overall score. The weighting scheme within any composite index represents the relative importance of each indicator to the overall aim of the measure, in the GPI's case, global peace. To fully understand the representative nature or accuracy of any measure it is necessary to understand how sensitive the results of the index are to the specific weighting scheme used. If the analysis holds true for a large subset of all possible weighting schemes then the results can be called robust. While it is expected that ranks will be sensitive to changes in the weights of any composite index, what is more important in a practical sense is the robustness of country comparisons. One of the core aims of the GPI is to allow for Country A to be compared to Country B. This raises the question that for any two countries, how often is the first ranked more peaceful than the second across the spectrum of weights. The more times that the first country is ranked more peaceful than the second, the more confidence can be invested in the statement "Country A is more peaceful than Country B".

To avoid the computational issue of evaluating every possible combination of 23 indicators, the robustness of pairwise country comparisons has been estimated using the three GPI domains militarisation, societal safety and security and ongoing conflict. Implementing an accepted methodology for robustness, the GPI is calculated for every weighting combination of three weights from 0 to 1 at 0.01 intervals. For computational expedience only weighting schemes that sum to one are selected, resulting in over 5100 recalculated GPI's. Applying this it is found that around 70 per cent of all pairwise country comparisons in the GPI are independent of the weighting scheme, i.e. 100 per cent robust. This is a similar level of absolute robustness as the Human Development Index.

QUALITATIVE SCORING:
THE ECONOMIST INTELLIGENCE UNIT APPROACH

The EIU's Country Analysis team plays an important role in producing the GPI by scoring seven qualitative indicators and


filling in data gaps on quantitative indicators when official data is missing. The EIU employs more than 100 full-time country experts and economists, supported by 650 in-country contributors. Analysts generally focus on two or three countries and, in conjunction with local contributors, develop a deep knowledge of a nation's political scene, the performance of its economy and the society in general. Scoring follows a strict process to ensure reliability, consistency and comparability:

1. Individual country analysts score qualitative indicators based on a scoring methodology and using a digital platform;
2. Regional directors use the digital platform to check scores across the region; through the platform they can see how individual countries fare against each other and evaluate qualitative assessments behind proposed score revisions;
3. Indicator scores are checked by the EIU's Custom Research team (which has responsibility for the GPI) to ensure global comparability;
4. If an indicator score is found to be questionable, the Custom Research team, and the appropriate regional director and country analyst discuss and make a judgment on the score;
5. Scores are assessed by the external advisory panel before finalising the GPI;
6. If the expert panel finds an indicator score to be questionable, the Custom Research team, and the appropriate regional director and country analyst discuss and make a final judgment on the score, which is then discussed in turn with the advisory panel.

Because of the large scope of the GPI, occasionally data for quantitative indicators do not extend to all nations. In this case, country analysts are asked to suggest an alternative data source or provide an estimate to fill any gap. This score is checked by Regional Directors to ensure reliability and consistency within the region, and by the Custom Research team to ensure global comparability. Again, indicators are assessed by the external advisory panel before finalisation.

Definition: Figures are from the Institute for Criminal Policy Research and are compiled from a variety of sources. In almost all cases the original source is the national prison administration of the country concerned, or else the Ministry responsible for the prison administration. Prison population rates per 100,000 people are based on estimates of the national population. In order to compare prison population rates, and to estimate the number of persons held in prison in the countries for which information is not available, median rates have been used by the Institute for Criminal Policy Research to minimise the effect of countries with rates that are untypically high or low. Indeed, comparability can be compromised by different practice in different countries, for example with regard to pre-trial detainees and juveniles, but also psychiatrically ill offenders and offenders being detained for treatment for alcoholism and drug addiction.

Definition: Assessment of the accessibility of small arms and light weapons (SALW), ranked from 1-5 (very limited access to very easy access) by the EIU's Country Analysis team. Country analysts are asked to assess this indicator on an annual basis, for the period from March to March.
Scoring Criteria:

1 = Very limited access: The country has developed policy instruments and best practices, such as firearm licences, strengthening of export controls, codes of conduct, firearms or ammunition marking.
2 = Limited access: The regulation implies that it is difficult, time-consuming and costly to obtain firearms; domestic firearms regulation also reduces the ease with which legal arms are diverted to illicit markets.
3 = Moderate access: There are regulations and commitment to ensure controls on civilian possession of firearms, although inadequate controls are not sufficient to stem the flow of illegal weapons.
4 = Easy access: There are basic regulations, but they are not effectively enforced; obtaining firearms is straightforward.
5 = Very easy access: There is no regulation of civilian possession, ownership, storage, carriage and use of firearms.

Scoring Criteria:


1 = No conflict.
2 = Latent conflict: Positional differences over definable values of national importance.
3 = Manifest conflict: Explicit threats of violence; imposition of economic sanctions by other countries.
4 = Crisis: A tense situation across most of the country; at least one group uses violent force in sporadic incidents.

Measurement period	2018
Definition: The Political Terror Scale (PTS) measures levels of political violence and terror that a country experiences in a given year based on a 5-level "terror scale" originally developed by Freedom House. The data used in compiling this index comes from two different sources: the yearly country reports of Amnesty International and the US Department of State's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices. The average of the two scores is taken.

Scoring Criteria



1 =  Countries under a secure rule of law, people are not imprisoned for their view, and torture is rare or exceptional. Political murders are extremely rare.
2 = There is a limited amount of imprisonment for nonviolent
political activity. However, few persons are affected, torture and beatings are exceptional. Political murder is rare.
3 = There is extensive political imprisonment, or a recent history
of such imprisonment. Execution or other political murders and brutality may be common. Unlimited detention, with or without a trial, for political views is accepted.
4 = Civil and political rights violations have expanded to large
numbers of the population. Murders, disappearances, and torture are a common part of life. In spite of its generality, on this level terror affects those who interest themselves in politics or ideas.
5 = Terror has expanded to the whole population. The leaders of
these societies place no limits on the means or thoroughness with which they pursue personal or ideological goals.

Measurement period	1 Jan 2015 to
20 March 2020



Definition: Terrorist incidents are defined as "intentional acts of violence or threat of violence by a non-state actor." This means an


incident has to meet three criteria in order for it to be counted as a terrorist act:


A The incident must be intentional - the result of a conscious calculation on the part of a perpetrator.


B The incident must entail some level of violence or threat of violence, including property violence as well as violence against people.


C The perpetrators of the incidents must be sub-national actors. This database does not include acts of state terrorism.


For all incidents listed, at least two of the following three criteria must be present:

1. The act must be aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious or social goal.
2. There must be evidence of an intention to coerce, intimidate or convey some other message to a larger audience (or audiences) than the immediate victims.
3. The action must be outside the context of legitimate warfare activities.

Methodology: Using the comprehensive, event-based Global Terrorism Database, the GTI combines four variables to develop a composite score: the number of terrorist incidents in a given year, the total number of fatalities in a given year, the total number of injuries caused in a given year and the approximate level of property damage in a given year. The composite score captures the direct effects of terrorist-related violence, in terms of its physical effect, but also attempts to reflect the residual effects of terrorism in terms of emotional wounds and fear by attributing a weighted average to the damage inflicted in previous years. As of the date of publication, the Global Terrorism Database only logs events up to 31 December 2018. To assess the impact of terrorism between this date and 20 March 2020 cutoff, IEP uses data from publicly available third party sources to impute terrorist activity in that period.

Definition: This indicator measures the number and duration of conflicts that occur within a specific country's legal boundaries. Information for this indicator is sourced from three datasets from Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP): the Battle-Related Deaths Dataset, Non-State Conflict Dataset and One-sided Violence Dataset. The score for a country is determined by adding the scores for all individual conflicts which have occurred within that country's legal boundaries over the last five years.

Each individual conflict score is based on the following factors:
Number:
 The number of interstate armed conflicts, internal armed conflict (civil conflicts), internationalised internal armed conflicts, one-sided conflict and non-state conflict located within a country's legal boundaries.
 If a conflict is a war (1,000+ battle-related deaths) it receives a score of one; if it is an armed conflict (25-999 battle-related deaths) it receives a score of 0.25.

Duration:
 A score is assigned based on the number of years out of the last five that conflict has occurred. For example, if a conflict last occurred five years ago that conflict will receive a score of one out of five.

The cumulative conflict scores are then added and banded to establish a country's score. This indicator is two years lagging due to when the UCDP data is released.

Indicator weight	2
Indicator weight (% of total index)	2.8%
Data source	International Institute for Strategic Studies, The Military Balance 2020
Measurement period	2019



Alternative Source: When no data was provided, several alternative sources were used: National Public Expenditure Accounts, SIPRI information and the Military Balance 2019. Alternative data are from 2008 to 2017, depending upon data availability.

Definition: Cash outlays of central or federal government to meet the costs of national armed forces-including strategic, land, naval, air, command, administration and support forces as well as paramilitary forces, customs forces and border guards if these are trained and equipped as a military force. Published EIU data on nominal GDP (or the World Bank when unavailable) was used to arrive at the value of military expenditure as a percentage of GDP.

Scoring Criteria: This indicator is scored using a min-max normalisation. Applying this method, a country's score is based on the distance of its military expenditure as a share of GDP from the benchmarks of 0% (for a score of 1) and 8.37% or above (for a score of 5). The bands, while linear, approximately conform as follows:

Financial Contribution to UN Peacekeeping Missions

Indicator weight (% of total index)	2.8%


Data source	IEP; United Nations Committee
on Contributions


Measurement period	2016-2018


Methodology: The UNFU indicator measures whether UN member countries meet their UN peacekeeping funding commitments. Although countries may fund other programs in development or peacebuilding, the records on peacekeeping are easy to obtain and understand and provide an instructive measure of a country's commitment to peace. The indicator calculates the percentage of countries' "outstanding payments versus their  annual assessment to the budget of the current peacekeeping missions" over an average of three years. This ratio is derived from data provided by the United Nations Committee on Contributions Status reports. The indicator is compiled as follows:

1. The status of contributions by UN member states is obtained.
2. For the relevant peacekeeping missions, the assessments (for that year only) and the collections (for that year only) are recorded. From this, the outstanding amount is calculated for that year.
3. The ratio of outstanding payments to assessments is calculated. By doing so a score between 0 and 1 is obtained. Zero indicates no money is owed; a country has met their funding commitments. A score of 1 indicates that a country has not paid any of their assessed contributions. Given that  the scores already fall between 0 and 1, they are easily banded into a score between 1 and 5. The final banded score is a weighted sum of the current year and the previous two years. The weightings are 0.5 for the current year, 0.3 for the previous year and 0.2 for two years prior. Hence it is a
three-year weighted average.
4. Outstanding payments from previous years and credits are not included. The scoring is linear to one decimal place.

Scoring Criteria

1/50-25% of stated contributions owed2/526-50% of stated contributions owed3/551-75% of stated contributions owed4/575-99% of stated contributions owed5/5100% of stated contributions owed(no contributions made in past three years)
Additional Notes: All United Nations member states share the costs of United Nations peacekeeping operations. The General Assembly apportions these expenses based on a special scale of assessments applicable to peacekeeping. This scale takes into account the relative economic wealth of member states, with the


permanent members of the Security Council required to pay a larger share because of their special responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security.

Nuclear and Heavy Weapons Capabilities
Indicator type	Quantitative
Indicator weight	3
Indicator weight (% of total index)	4.2%
Data source	IEP; SIPRI; IISS The Military Balance; United Nations Register of Conventional Arms
Measurement period	2018



Methodology: This indicator is based on a categorised system for rating the destructive capability of a country's stock of heavy weapons. Holdings are those of government forces and do not include holdings of armed opposition groups. Heavy weapons numbers were determined using a combination of the  International Institute for Strategic Studies, The Military Balance and the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms.

There are five categories of weapons, each of which receive a certain number of weighted points. The five weapons categories are weighted as follows:
1. Armoured vehicle and artillery pieces = 1 point


2. Tank = 5 points


3. Combat aircraft and combat helicopter = 20 points


4. Warship = 100 points


5. Aircraft carrier and nuclear submarine = 1000 points



Countries with nuclear capabilities automatically receive the maximum score of five. Other scores are expressed to the second decimal point, adopting a min-max normalisation that sets the max at two standard deviations above the average raw score.

Data source	IEP; UCDP Battle- Related Deaths Dataset
Measurement period	2014-2018



Definition: This indicator measures the number and duration of extraterritorial conflicts a country is involved in. Information for this indicator is sourced from the UCDP Battle-Related Deaths Dataset. The score for a country is determined by adding all individual conflict scores where that country is involved as an actor in a conflict outside its legal boundaries. Conflicts are not counted against a country if they have already been counted against that country in the number and duration of internal conflicts indicator.

Each individual conflict score is based on the following factors:

Number:
 Number of internationalised internal armed conflicts and interstate armed conflicts.
 If a conflict is a war (1,000+ battle-related deaths)
it receives a score of one; if it is an armed conflict (25-999 battle-related deaths) it receives a score of 0.25.

Duration:
 A score is assigned based on the number of years out of the last five that conflict has occurred. For example, if a conflict last occurred five years ago that conflict will receive a score of one out of five.

Role:
 If the country is a primary party to the conflict, that conflict receives a score of one; if it is a secondary party (supporting the primary party), that conflict receives a score of 0.25.
 If a country is a party to a force covered by a relevant United Nations Security Council Resolution, then the entire conflict score is multiplied by a quarter; if not, it receives a full score.

The different conflict scores are then added and banded to establish a country's score.
